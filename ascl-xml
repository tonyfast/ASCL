Program features include the ability to include the brightness of the lens and to compute the probability of lens detection at any level of lensing amplification. The program limits itself to lensing by single stars of single sources. The program is currently setup to accept input from the Galactic models of Bahcall and Soniera (1982, 1986).

There are three files needed for LENSKY, the Fortran file lensky.for and two input files: galmod.dsk (15 Megs) and galmod.sph (22 Megs). The zip file available below contains all three files. The program generates output to the file lensky.out. The program is pretty self-explanatory past that.

Toward this end, the program simulates a small camera/telescope or group of small camera/telescopes collecting light from a large portion of the sky. From a given stellar density derived from a Bahcall - Soneira Galaxy model, the program first converts star densities at visual magnitudes between 5 and 20 to number of sky pixels needed to monitor each star simultaneously. From pixels, the program converts input CCD parameters to needed telescope attributes, needed data storage space, and the length of time needed to accumulate data of photometric quality for stars of each limiting visual magnitude over the whole sky. The program steps though photometric integrations one second at a time and includes the contribution from a bright background, read noise, dark current, and atmospheric absorption.</abstract><bibcode>1999ascl.soft05001N</bibcode><topic_id>20404</topic_id><views>44</views><site>http://asterisk.apod.com/download/file.php?id=3369</site></code><code><ascl_id>9905.002</ascl_id><title>ICOSAHEDRON: A package for pixelizing the sphere</title><credit>Tegmark, Max</credit><abstract>What is the best way to pixelize a sphere?

We derive a second-order differential equation for the angular size distance valid not only in all homogeneous Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmological models, parametrised by $lambda_{0}$ and $Omega_{0}$, but also in inhomogeneous 'on-average' Friedmann-Lemaitre models, where the inhomogeneity is given by the (in the general case redshift-dependent) parameter $eta$. Since most other distances can be obtained trivially from the angular size distance, and since the differential equation can be efficiently solved numerically, this offers for the first time a practical method for calculating distances in a large class of cosmological models.

Since galaxies are usually observed to have elliptical light distributions, mass distributions with elliptical density contours offer more general and realistic lens models. They are difficult to use, however, since previous studies have shown that the deflection angle (and magnification) in this case can only be obtained by rather expensive numerical integrations. We present a family of lens models for which the deflection can be calculated to high relative accuracy (10-5) with a greatly reduced numerical effort, for small and large ellipticity alike. This makes it easier to use these distributions for modeling individual lenses as well as for applications requiring larger computing times, such as statistical lensing studies. FASTELL is a code to calculate quickly and accurately the lensing deflection and magnification matrix for the softened power-law elliptical mass distribution (SPEMD) lens galaxy model.

The code can handle both spherical and planar geometries. The user specifies the properties of the radiation source and dusty region, and the code calculates the dust temperature distribution and the radiation field in it. The solution method is  based on a self-consistent equation for the radiative energy density, including dust scattering, absorption and emission, and does not introduce any approximations. The solution is exact to within the specified numerical accuracy. DUSTY has built in optical properties for the most common types of astronomical dust and comes with a library for many other grains. It supports various analytical forms for the density distribution, and can perform a full dynamical calculation for radiatively driven winds around AGB stars. The spectral energy distribution of the source can be specified analytically as either Planckian or broken power-law. In addition, arbitrary dust optical properties, density distributions and external radiation can be entered in user supplied files. Furthermore, the wavelength grid can be modified to accommodate spectral features. A single DUSTY run can process an unlimited number of models, with each input set producing a run of optical depths, as specified.

The tree construction uses fast, parallel sorts. The sorted lists are recursively divided along their x, y and z coordinates. This data structure is a completely balanced tree (i.e., each particle is paired with exactly one other particle) and maintains good spatial locality. An implementation of this tree-building algorithm on a 16k processor Maspar MP-1 performs well and constitutes only a small fraction (approximately 15%) of the entire cycle of finding the accelerations. Each node in the tree is treated as a monopole. The tree search and the summation of accelerations also perform well. During the tree search, node data that is needed from another processor is simply fetched. Roughly 55% of the tree search time is spent in communications between processors. We apply the code to two problems of astrophysical interest. The first is a simulation of the close passage of two gravitationally, interacting, disk galaxies using 65,636 particles. We also simulate the formation of structure in an expanding, model universe using 1,048,576 particles. Our code attains speeds comparable to one head of a Cray Y-MP, so single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) type computers can be used for these simulations. The cost/performance ratio for SIMD machines like the Maspar MP-1 make them an extremely attractive alternative to either vector processors or large multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) type parallel computers. With further optimizations (e.g., more careful load balancing), speeds in excess of today's vector processing computers should be possible.</abstract><bibcode>1999ascl.soft12001O</bibcode><topic_id>21815</topic_id><views>39</views><site>http://www.wesman.net/~wesley/ucb/cs184/second/README</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJS...94..117</ref></code><code><ascl_id>9912.002</ascl_id><title>FTOOLS: A general package of software to manipulate FITS files</title><credit>Blackburn, J.

The utility programs for FITS tables are especially rich and powerful, and provide functions for presentation of file contents, extraction of specific rows or columns, appending or merging tables, binning values in a column or selecting subsets of rows based on a boolean expression. Individual FTOOLS programs can easily be chained together in scripts to achieve more complex operations such as the generation and displaying of spectra or light curves. FTOOLS  development began in 1991 and has produced the main set of data analysis software for the current ASCA and RXTE space missions and for other archival sets of X-ray and gamma-ray data. The FTOOLS software package is supported on most UNIX platforms and on Windows 98/NT machines. The user interface is controlled by standard parameter files that are very similar to those used by IRAF. The package is self documenting through a stand alone help task called fhelp. Software is written in ANSI C and FORTRAN to provide portability across most computer systems. The data format dependencies between hardware platforms are isolated through the FITSIO  library package.</abstract><bibcode>1999ascl.soft12002B</bibcode><topic_id>20398</topic_id><views>90</views><site>http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/ftools_menu.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...492..511K</ref></code><code><ascl_id>9912.003</ascl_id><title>RVSAO 2.0: Digital Redshifts and Radial Velocities</title><credit>Kurtz, Michael J.; Mink, Douglas J.</credit><abstract>RVSAO is a set of programs to obtain redshifts and radial velocities from digital spectra. RVSAO operates in the IRAF (Tody 1986, 1993) environment. The heart of the system is xcsao, which implements the cross-correlation method, and is a direct descendant of the system built by Tonry and Davis (1979). emsao uses intelligent heuristics to search for emission lines in spectra, then fits them to obtain a redshift. sumspec shifts and sums spectra to build templates for cross-correlation. linespec builds synthetic spectra given a list of spectral lines. bcvcorr corrects velocities for the motion of the earth. We discuss in detail the parameters necessary to run xcsao and emsao properly. We discuss the reliability and error associated with xcsao derived redshifts. We develop an internal error estimator, and we show how large, stable surveys can be used to develop more accurate error estimators. We develop a new methodology for building spectral templates for galaxy redshifts. We show how to obtain correlation velocities using emission line templates. Emission line correlations are substantially more efficient than the previous standard technique, automated emission line fitting. We compare the use of RVSAO with new methods, which use Singular Value Decomposition and $chi^2$ fitting techniques.</abstract><bibcode>1999ascl.soft12003K</bibcode><topic_id>21816</topic_id><views>53</views><site>http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/iraf/rvsao/rvsao.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PASP..110..934K</ref></code><code><ascl_id>0003.001</ascl_id><title>GADGET-2: A Code for Cosmological Simulations of Structure Formation</title><credit>Springel, Volker</credit><abstract>The cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, is capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10^10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10^5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.</abstract><bibcode>2000ascl.soft03001S</bibcode><topic_id>21802</topic_id><views>97</views><site>http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.364.1105S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>0003.002</ascl_id><title>SAOImage DS9: A utility for displaying astronomical images in the X11 window environment</title><credit>Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</credit><abstract>SAOImage DS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application.

The DDA approximates the target by an array of polarizable points. DDSCAT.5a requires that these polarizable points be located on a cubic lattice. DDSCAT allows accurate calculations of electromagnetic scattering from targets with "size parameters" 2 pi a/lambda &lt; 15 provided the refractive index m is not large compared to unity (|m-1| &lt; 1). The DDSCAT package is written in Fortran and is highly portable. The program supports calculations for a variety of target geometries (e.g., ellipsoids, regular tetrahedra, rectangular solids, finite cylinders, hexagonal prisms, etc.). Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to import arbitrary target geometries into the code, and relatively straightforward to add new target generation capability to the package. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for specified orientation of the target relative to the incident wave, and for specified scattering directions. This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT to carry out EM scattering calculations. CPU and memory requirements are described.</abstract><bibcode>2000ascl.soft08001D</bibcode><topic_id>20401</topic_id><views>55</views><site>http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/DDSCAT.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008JOSAA..25.2693D</ref></code><code><ascl_id>0008.002</ascl_id><title>RATRAN: Radiative Transfer and Molecular Excitation in One and Two Dimensions</title><credit>Hogerheijde, Michiel; van der Tak, Floris</credit><abstract>RATRAN is a numerical method and computer code to calculate the radiative transfer and excitation of molecular lines. The approach is based on the Monte Carlo method, and incorporates elements from Accelerated Lambda Iteration. It combines the flexibility of the former with the speed and accuracy of the latter. Convergence problems known to plague Monte Carlo methods at large optical depth (>100) are avoided by separating local contributions to the radiation field from the overall transfer problem. The random nature of the Monte Carlo method serves to verify the independence of the solution to the angular, spatial, and frequency sampling of the radiation field. This allows the method to be used in a wide variety of astrophysical problems without specific adaptations. Moreover, the code can be applied to all atoms or molecules for which collisional rate coefficients are available and any axially symmetric source model. Continuum emission and absorption by dust is explicitly taken into account but scattering is neglected. We expect this program to be an important tool in analyzing data from present and future infrared and (sub-)millimeter telescopes.</abstract><bibcode>2000ascl.soft08002H</bibcode><topic_id>21819</topic_id><views>72</views><site>http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/ratran/frames.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007astro.ph..2385V</ref></code><code><ascl_id>0011.001</ascl_id><title>StarFinder: A code for stellar field analysis</title><credit>Diolaiti, Emiliano; Bendinelli, Orazio; Bonaccini, Domenico; Close, Laird M.; Currie, Doug G.; Parmeggiani, Gianluigi</credit><abstract>StarFinder is an IDL code for the deep analysis of stellar fields, designed for Adaptive Optics well-sampled images with high and low Strehl ratio.

The code is purely grid-based and uses a recursively refined Cartesian grid to solve Poisson's equation for the potential, rather than obtaining the potential from a Green's function. Refinements can have arbitrary shapes and in practice closely follow the complex morphology of the density field that evolves. The timestep shortens by a factor two with each successive refinement. It is argued that an appropriate choice of softening length is of great importance and that the softening should be at all points an appropriate multiple of the local inter-particle separation. Unlike tree and P3M codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfy this requirement. We show that at early times and low densities in cosmological simulations, the softening needs to be significantly smaller relative to the inter-particle separation than in virialized regions. Tests of the ability of the code's Poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of both virialized halos and Zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code's ability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution. The times required to conduct a LCDM cosmological simulation for various configurations are compared with the times required to complete the same simulation with the ART, AP3M and GADGET codes. The power spectra, halo mass functions and halo-halo correlation functions of simulations conducted with different codes are compared.</abstract><bibcode>2001ascl.soft04001K</bibcode><topic_id>20390</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://popia.ft.uam.es/MLAPM/</site></code><code><ascl_id>0104.002</ascl_id><title>CSENV: A code for the chemistry of CircumStellar ENVelopes</title><credit>Mamon, Gary A.; Glassgold, Al</credit><abstract>CSENV is a code that computes the chemical abundances for a desired set of species as a function of radius in a stationary, non-clumpy, <span style="font-weight: bold">C</span>ircum<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tellar <span style="font-weight: bold">ENV</span>elope.

Cosmic ray ionization can be included.  Chemical reaction rates are specified with possible activation temperatures and additional power-law dependences.

fpack uses the tiled image compression convention for storing the compressed images. This convention can in principle support any number of of different compression algorithms; currently GZIP, Rice, Hcompress, and the IRAF pixel list compression algorithms have been implemented.

The main advantages of fpack compared to the commonly used technique of externally compressing the whole FITS file with gzip are:

S.; Peterson, Bradley. M.</credit><abstract>SPEAR is a new approach to reverberation mapping that computes the lags between the AGN continuum and emission line light curves and their statistical confidence limits. It uses a damped random walk model to describe the quasar continuum variability and the ansatz that emission line variability is a scaled, smoothed and displaced version of the continuum. While currently configured only to simultaneously fit light curve means, it includes a general linear parameters formalism to fit more complex trends or calibration offsets. The noise matrix can be modified to allow for correlated errors, and the correlation matrix can be modified to use a different stochastic process. The transfer function model is presently a tophat, but this can be altered by changing the line-continuum covariance matrices. It is also able to cope with some problems in traditional reverberation mapping, such as irregular sampling, correlated errors and seasonal gaps.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10007Z</bibcode><topic_id>21495</topic_id><views>81</views><site>http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~yingzu/spear.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...735...80Z</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.008</ascl_id><title>midIR_sensitivity: Mid-infrared astronomy with METIS</title><credit>Kendrew, Sarah; Jolissaint, Laurent; Brandl, Bernhard; Lenzen, Rainer; Pantin, Eric; Glasse, Alistair; Blommaert, Joris; Venema, Lars; Siebenmorgen, Ralf; Molster, Frank</credit><abstract>midIR_sensitivity is idl code that calculates the sensitivity of a ground-based mid-infrared instrument for astronomy.

This deviation also requires a change in the cold dark matter density which in a flat LCDM model is disfavored by current supernova and Hubble constant data and can be tested with future polarization or high multipole temperature data.

It was developed primarily for studies of the interstellar medium, star formation, and accretion flows. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher-order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume-averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area-averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally-split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally-unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and Fortran95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

The purpose of flagging is to mark samples that are affected by interfering sources such as radio stations, airplanes, electrical fences or other transmitting interferers.

The tools in the package are meant for offline use. The software package contains a graphical interface ("rfigui") that can be used to visualize a measurement set and analyze mitigation techniques. It also contains a console flagger ("rficonsole") that can execute a script of mitigation functions without the overhead of a graphical environment. All tools were written in C++.

The software has been tested extensively on low radio frequencies (150 MHz or lower) produced by the WSRT and LOFAR telescopes. LOFAR is the Low Frequency Array that is built in and around the Netherlands. Higher frequencies should work as well. Some of the methods implemented are the SumThreshold, the VarThreshold and the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Included also are several surface fitting algorithms.

While limited to low spatial resolution, the next generation low-frequency radio interferometers that target 21 cm observations during the era of reionization and prior will have instantaneous fields-of-view that are many tens of square degrees on the sky. Predictions related to various statistical measurements of the 21 cm brightness temperature must then be pursued with numerical simulations of reionization with correspondingly large volume box sizes, of order 1000 Mpc on one side. The authors pursued a semi-numerical scheme to simulate the 21 cm signal during and prior to Reionization by extending a hybrid approach where simulations are performed by first laying down the linear dark matter density field, accounting for the non-linear evolution of the density field based on second-order linear perturbation theory as specified by the Zel'dovich approximation, and then specifying the location and mass of collapsed dark matter halos using the excursion-set formalism. The location of ionizing sources and the time evolving distribution of ionization field is also specified using an excursion-set algorithm. They account for the brightness temperature evolution through the coupling between spin and gas temperature due to collisions, radiative coupling in the presence of Lyman-alpha photons and heating of the intergalactic medium, such as due to a background of X-ray photons. The method is capable of producing the required large volume simulations with adequate resolution in a reasonable time so a large number of realizations can be obtained with variations in assumptions related to astrophysics and background cosmology that govern the 21 cm signal.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10025S</bibcode><topic_id>21583</topic_id><views>63</views><site>http://www.simfast21.org/</site><ref>http://www.simfast21.org/</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.026</ascl_id><title>SingLe: A F90-package devoted to Softened Gravity in gaseous discs</title><credit>Huré, Jean-Marc; Pierens, Arnaud</credit><abstract><strong>S</strong><small>often</small><strong>ingLe</strong><small>ngth</small>: Because Newton's law of Gravitation diverges as the relative separations |r'-r| tends to zero, it is common to add a positive constant λ also known as the "softening length", i.e. :

The method uses one or more particles, which explore a mixture of nested probability distributions, each successive distribution occupying ~e^-1 times the enclosed prior mass of the previous distribution. While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration fits naturally into this technique. This method can achieve four times the accuracy of classic MCMC-based Nested Sampling, for the same computational effort; equivalent to a factor of 16 speedup. An additional benefit is that more samples and a more accurate evidence value can be obtained simply by continuing the run for longer, as in standard MCMC.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10029B</bibcode><topic_id>21591</topic_id><views>54</views><site>http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~brewer/DNest/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.030</ascl_id><title>CosmicEmu: Cosmic Emulator for the Dark Matter Power Spectrum</title><credit>Lawrence, Earl; Heitmann, Katrin; White, Martin; Higdon, David; Wagner, Christian; Habib, Salman; Williams, Brian</credit><abstract>Many of the most exciting questions in astrophysics and cosmology, including the majority of observational probes of dark energy, rely on an understanding of the nonlinear regime of structure formation.

With SLR, stars in any field are "standards." This is an entirely new way to calibrate photometry. SLR exploits the simple fact that most stars lie along a well defined line in color-color space called the stellar locus. Cross-match point-sources in flattened images taken through different passbands and plot up all color vs color combinations, and you will see the stellar locus with little effort. SLR calibrates colors by fitting these colors to a standard line. Cross-match with 2MASS on top of that, and SLR will deliver calibrated magnitudes as well.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10035H</bibcode><topic_id>21633</topic_id><views>44</views><site>http://code.google.com/p/stellar-locus-regression/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....138..110H</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.036</ascl_id><title>Montage: An Astronomical Image Mosaicking Toolkit</title><credit>Jacob, Joseph C.; Katz, Daniel S.; Berriman, G.

The Fast Chi-squared technique takes a data set (e.g. the brightness of a star measured at many different times during a series of observations) and finds the periodic function that has the best frequency and shape (to an arbitrary number of harmonics) to fit the data. Among its advantages are:
<ul><li>Statistical efficiency: all of the data are used, weighted by their individual error bars, giving a result with a significance calibrated in well-understood Chi-squared statistics. </li><li>Sensitivity to harmonic content: many conventional techniques look only at the significance (or the amplitude) of the fundamental sinusoid and discard the power of the higher harmonics. </li><li>Insensitivity to the sample timing: you won't find a period of 24 hours just because you take your observations at night.

Our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshift range 0&lt;~z&lt;~1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0&lt;~z&lt;~5.58. We use our templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they are relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for AGNs are a strong function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components. Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error. We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed by Stern et al.(2005) and Lacy et al.(2004). We find that the Stern et al.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a strong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad Halpha emission line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by low and intermediate redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al.(2004) criterion is not affected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift star forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color-color distribution of sources in the upcoming WISE mission and define a color criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these criteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z &gt;~ 3.4.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10038A</bibcode><topic_id>21674</topic_id><views>50</views><site>http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~rjassef/lrt/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5415</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.039</ascl_id><title>Parameter Estimation from Time-Series Data with Correlated Errors: A Wavelet-Based Method and its Application to Transit Light Curves</title><credit>Carter, Joshua A.; Winn, Joshua N.</credit><abstract>We consider the problem of fitting a parametric model to time-series data that are afflicted by correlated noise.

The two-point correlation function is unbiased by missing data but its direct calculation will soon become a burden with the exponential growth of astronomical data sets. The power spectrum is fast to estimate but a mask correction should be estimated. Other statistics can be used but these are strongly sensitive to missing data. The solution that is proposed by FASTLens is to properly fill-in the gaps with only NlogN operations, leading to a complete weak lensing mass map from which one can compute straight forwardly and with a very good accuracy any kind of statistics like power spectrum or bispectrum.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10041P</bibcode><topic_id>21687</topic_id><views>51</views><site>http://irfu.cea.fr/Ast/fastlens.software.php</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4068</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.042</ascl_id><title>WeightMixer: Hybrid Cross-power Spectrum Estimation</title><credit>Lewis, Antony</credit><abstract>This code, wihch requires <a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> 2.x, allows you to generate power spectrum estimators from WMAP 5-year maps and generate hybrid cross- and auto- power spectrum and covariance from general foreground-cleaned maps.

In a series of earlier papers we described the development of MAESTRO, a low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code that can be used to simulate long-time, low-speed flows that would be prohibitively expensive to model using traditional compressible codes. MAESTRO is based on an equation set derived using low Mach number asymptotics; this equation set does not explicitly track acoustic waves and thus allows a significant increase in the time step. MAESTRO is suitable for two- and three-dimensional local atmospheric flows as well as three-dimensional full-star flows. Here, we continue the development of MAESTRO by incorporating adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The primary difference between MAESTRO and other structured grid AMR approaches for incompressible and low Mach number flows is the presence of the time-dependent base state, whose evolution is coupled to the evolution of the full solution. We also describe how to incorporate the expansion of the base state for full-star flows, which involves a novel mapping technique between the one-dimensional base state and the Cartesian grid, as well as a number of overall improvements to the algorithm. We examine the efficiency and accuracy of our adaptive code, and demonstrate that it is suitable for further study of our initial scientific application, the convective phase of Type Ia supernovae.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10044N</bibcode><topic_id>23446</topic_id><views>50</views><site>https://ccse.lbl.gov/Research/MAESTRO/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0112</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2801</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0609</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.045</ascl_id><title>PLUTO: A Code for Flows in Multiple Spatial Dimensions</title><credit>Mignone, Andrea; Tzeferacos, P.; Zanni, C.; Tesileanu, O.; Matsakos, T.; Bodo, G.</credit><abstract>PLUTO is a modular Godunov-type code intended mainly for astrophysical applications and high Mach number flows in multiple spatial dimensions.

By "fully calibrated" one should understand wavelength and relative flux-calibrated data. Note that the different types of line-strength indices that can be measured with indexf (see below) do not require absolute flux calibration. If even a relative flux-calibration is absent (or deficient), the derived indices should be transformed to an appropriate spectrophotometric system. The program can also compute index errors resulting from the propagation of random errors (e.g. photon statistics, read-out noise). This option is only available if the user provides the error spectrum as an additional input FITS file to indexf. The error spectrum must contain the unbiased standard deviation (and not the variance!) for each pixel of the data spectrum. In addition, indexf also estimates the effect of errors on radial velocity. For this purpose, the program performs Monte Carlo simulations by measuring each index using randomly drawn radial velocities (following a Gaussian distribution of a given standard deviation).

The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. A redshift quality parameter, Q_z, provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10052B</bibcode><topic_id>21717</topic_id><views>50</views><site>http://www.astro.yale.edu/eazy/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2595</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.053</ascl_id><title>Halofitting codes for DGP and Degravitation</title><credit>Khoury, J.; Wyman, M.</credit><abstract>We perform N-body simulations of theories with infinite-volume extra dimensions, such as the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model and its higher-dimensional generalizations, where 4D gravity is mediated by massive gravitons. The longitudinal mode of these gravitons mediates an extra scalar force, which we model as a density-dependent modification to the Poisson equation. This enhances gravitational clustering, particularly on scales that have undergone mild nonlinear processing. While the standard non-linear fitting algorithm of Smith et al. overestimates this power enhancement on non-linear scales, we present a modified fitting formula that offers a remarkably good fit to our power spectra. Due to the uncertainty in galaxy bias, our results are consistent with precision power spectrum determinations from galaxy redshift surveys, even for graviton Compton wavelengths as small as 300 Mpc. Our model is sufficiently general that we expect it to capture the phenomenology of a wide class of related higher-dimensional gravity scenarios.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10053K</bibcode><topic_id>21726</topic_id><views>48</views><site>http://www.markcwyman.com/Code/</site></code><code><ascl_id>1010.054</ascl_id><title>MagnetiCS.c: Cosmic String Loop Evolution and Magnetogenesis</title><credit>Battefeld, Diana; Battefeld, Thorsten; Wesley, Daniel H.; Wyman, Mark</credit><abstract>Large-scale coherent magnetic fields are observed in galaxies and clusters, but their ultimate origin remains a mystery. We reconsider the prospects for primordial magnetogenesis by a cosmic string network. We show that the magnetic flux produced by long strings has been overestimated in the past, and give improved estimates. We also compute the fields created by the loop population, and find that it gives the dominant contribution to the total magnetic field strength on present-day galactic scales. We present numerical results obtained by evolving semi-analytic models of string networks (including both one-scale and velocity-dependent one-scale models) in a Lambda-CDM cosmology, including the forces and torques on loops from Hubble redshifting, dynamical friction, and gravitational wave emission. Our predictions include the magnetic field strength as a function of correlation length, as well as the volume covered by magnetic fields. We conclude that string networks could account for magnetic fields on galactic scales, but only if coupled with an efficient dynamo amplification mechanism.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10054B</bibcode><topic_id>21727</topic_id><views>49</views><site>http://www.markcwyman.com/Code/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2901</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.055</ascl_id><title>SYNOW: A Highly Parameterized Spectrum Synthesis Code for Direct Analysis of SN Spectra</title><credit>Parrent, Jerod; Branch, David; Jeffery, David</credit><abstract>SYNOW is a highly parameterized spectrum synthesis code used primarily for direct (empirical) analysis of SN spectra.

Synow does not do continuum transport, it does not solve rate equations, and it does not calculate ionization ratios. Its main function is to take line multiple scattering into account so that it can be used in an empirical spirit to make line identifications and estimate the velocity at the photosphere (or pseudo-photosphere) and the velocity interval within which each ion is detected. these quantities provide constraints on the composition structure of the ejected matter.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10055P</bibcode><topic_id>21730</topic_id><views>56</views><site>http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~parrent/synow.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1671</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.056</ascl_id><title>PHOENIX: A General-purpose State-of-the-art Stellar and Planetary Atmosphere Code</title><credit>Baron, E.; Chen, Bin; Hauschildt, P.

The solution of the quasi-static equilibrium is performed by a collocation method based on piecewise polynomials approximations projected on a B-spline basis; that allows stable and robust calculations, and the exact restitution of the solution, not only at grid points, even for the discontinuous variables. Other advantages are the monitoring by only one parameter of the accuracy and its improvement by super-convergence. An automatic mesh refinement has been designed for adjusting the localisations of grid points according to the changes of unknowns. For standard models, the evolution of the chemical composition is solved by stiffly stable schemes of orders up to four; in the convection zones mixing and evolution of chemical are simultaneous. The solution of the diffusion equation employs the Galerkin finite elements scheme; the mixing of chemicals is then performed by a strong turbulent diffusion.

Typical scientific targets include driven MHD turbulence in a periodic box, convection in a slab with non-periodic upper and lower boundaries, a convective star embedded in a fully nonperiodic box, accretion disc turbulence in the shearing sheet approximation, self-gravity, non-local radiation transfer, dust particle evolution with feedback on the gas, etc. A range of artificial viscosity and diffusion schemes can be invoked to deal with supersonic flows.

Perturbation theory is performed about a background Minkowski spacetime to O[(v/c)^4] beyond Newtonian gravity, where v is the typical speed of these n particles in their center of energy frame. For the specific case of the 2 body problem, the major efforts underway to measure gravitational waves produced by in-spiraling compact astrophysical binaries require their gravitational interactions to be computed beyond the currently known O[(v/c)^7]. We argue that such higher order post-Newtonian calculations must be automated for these field theoretic methods to be applied successfully to achieve this goal. In view of this, we outline an algorithm that would in principle generate the relevant Feynman diagrams to an arbitrary order in v/c and take steps to develop the necessary software.

Recently, the scope and complexity of these simulations has increased dramatically, for three reasons: 1) the sheer size of the data sets, measured in Terabytes, make traditional 'awking and grepping' of a single output file impractical; 2) the addition of stellar evolution data brings qualitatively new challenges to the data reduction; 3) increased realism of the simulations invites realistic forms of 'SOS': Simulations of Observations of Simulations, to be compared directly with observations.

Further efforts in this direction are strongly encouraged so that the current extrapolations of collisional rate coefficients can be replaced by actual calculations in future releases.

Astronomy makes an extended use of visualization techniques to analyze data, and scientific visualization has became a fundamental part of modern researches in Astronomy. With the evolution of high performance computers, numerical simulations have assumed a great role in the scientific investigation, allowing the user to run simulation with higher and higher resolution. Data produced in these simulations are often multi-dimensional arrays with several physical quantities. These data are very hard to manage and to analyze efficiently. Consequently the data analysis and visualization tools must follow the new requirements of the research. AstroMD is a tool for data analysis and visualization of astrophysical data and can manage different physical quantities and multi-dimensional data sets. The tool uses virtual reality techniques by which the user has the impression of travelling through a computer-based multi-dimensional model.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft10078B</bibcode><topic_id>21823</topic_id><views>96</views><site>http://cosmolab.cineca.it/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006402</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1010.079</ascl_id><title>Geant4: A Simulation Toolkit for the Passage of Particles through Matter</title><credit>Geant4 Collaboration</credit><abstract>Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter.

Long-range forces are computed using a Fourier transform gravity solver on a regular mesh; the mesh is distributed across parallel processes using a static one-dimensional slab domain decomposition. Short-range forces are computed by direct summation of close pairs; particles are distributed using a dynamic domain decomposition based on a space-filling Hilbert curve. A nearly-optimal method was devised to dynamically repartition the particle distribution so as to maintain load balance even for extremely inhomogeneous mass distributions. Tests using $800^3$ simulations on a 40-processor beowulf cluster showed good load balance and scalability up to 80 processes.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics.

The spectral energy distribution (SED) templates are computed for nine spectral types including starburst, irregular, spiral and elliptical. Dust, extinction and metal effects are coherently taken into account, depending on evolution scenarios. The sensitivity of results to adding near-infrared colors and IGM absorption is analyzed. A comparison with results of other models without evolution measures the evolution factor which systematically increases the estimated photometric redshift values by $Delta z$ &gt; 0.2 for z &gt; 1.5. Moreover we systematically check that the evolution scenarios match observational standard templates of nearby galaxies, implying an age constraint of the stellar population at z=0 for each type. The respect of this constraint makes it possible to significantly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts by decreasing the well-known degeneracy problem. The method is applied to the HDF-N sample. From fits on SED templates by a $chi^2$-minimization procedure, not only is the photometric redshift derived but also the corresponding spectral type and the formation redshift $z_for$ when stars first formed. Early epochs of galaxy formation z &gt; 5 are found from this new method and results are compared to faint galaxy count interpretations.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11003L</bibcode><topic_id>21889</topic_id><views>112</views><site>http://www2.iap.fr/pegase/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0202359</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.004</ascl_id><title>MARS: The MAGIC Analysis and Reconstruction Software</title><credit>Moralejo, R.

Through extensive numerical study we characterize these attractor loop shapes including their length, velocity, kink, and cusp distributions. We find that an initial loop containing $M$ harmonic modes will, on average, split into 3M stable loops. These stable loops are approximately described by the degenerate kinky loop, which is planar and rectangular, independently of the number of modes on the initial loop. This is confirmed by an analytic construction of a stable family of perturbed degenerate kinky loops. The average stable loop is also found to have a 40% chance of containing a cusp. We examine the properties of stable loops of different lengths and find only slight variation. Finally we develop a new analytic scheme to explicitly solve the string constraint equations.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11005C</bibcode><topic_id>21911</topic_id><views>39</views><site>http://www.phys.cwru.edu/projects/strings/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4030</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.006</ascl_id><title>DAME: A Web Oriented Infrastructure for Scientific Data Mining & Exploration</title><credit>Brescia, Massimo; Longo, Giuseppe; Djorgovski, George S.; Cavuoti, Stefano; D'Abrusco, Raffaele; Donalek, Ciro; di Guido, Alessandro; Fiore, Michelangelo; Garofalo, Mauro; Laurino, Omar; Mahabal, Ashish; Manna, Francesco; Nocella, Alfonso; D'Angelo, Giovanni; Paolillo, Maurizio</credit><abstract>DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) is an innovative, general purpose, Web-based, VObs compliant, istributed data mining infrastructure specialized in Massive Data Sets exploration with machine learning methods.

It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 97), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated to shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density LCDM universe are finally reported, with 256^3 particles and 4.1 10^7 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192^3. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloes temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11007T</bibcode><topic_id>21913</topic_id><views>61</views><site>http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html</site><site>https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...385..337T</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.008</ascl_id><title>Binsim: Visualising Interacting Binaries in 3D</title><credit>Hynes, R.

This process, known as preheating, is rather violent, inhomogeneous and non-linear, and has to be studied numerically. This paper presents a new code for simulating scalar field dynamics in expanding universe written for that purpose. Compared to available alternatives, it significantly improves both the speed and the accuracy of calculations, and is fully instrumented for 3D visualization. We reproduce previously published results on preheating in simple chaotic inflation models, and further investigate non-linear dynamics of the inflaton decay. Surprisingly, we find that the fields do not want to thermalize quite the way one would think. Instead of directly reaching equilibrium, the evolution appears to be stuck in a rather simple but quite inhomogeneous state. In particular, one-point distribution function of total energy density appears to be universal among various two-field preheating models, and is exceedingly well described by a lognormal distribution. It is tempting to attribute this state to scalar field turbulence.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11012F</bibcode><topic_id>21925</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/defrost/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4904</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.013</ascl_id><title>EasyLTB: Code for Testing LTB Models against Cosmology

In this paper we confront the asymptotically flat Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models with a series of observations, from Type Ia Supernovae to Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data. We propose two concrete LTB models describing a local void in which the only arbitrary functions are the radial dependence of the matter density Omega_M and the Hubble expansion rate H. We find that all observations can be accommodated within 1 sigma, for our models with 4 or 5 independent parameters. The best fit models have a chi^2 very close to that of the LCDM model.

It is used to model solar and stellar surface convection. For solar-type stars only a small fraction of the stellar surface layers are included in the computational domain. In the case of red supergiants the computational box contains the entire star. Recently, the model range has been extended to sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs).

CO5BOLD solves the coupled non-linear equations of compressible hydrodynamics in an external gravity field together with non-local frequency-dependent radiation transport. Operator splitting is applied to solve the equations of hydrodynamics (including gravity), the radiative energy transfer (with a long-characteristics or a short-characteristics ray scheme), and possibly additional 3D (turbulent) diffusion in individual sub steps. The 3D hydrodynamics step is further simplified with directional splitting (usually). The 1D sub steps are performed with a Roe solver, accounting for an external gravity field and an arbitrary equation of state from a table.

The radiation transport is computed with either one of three modules:

<ul><li>MSrad module: It uses long characteristics. The lateral boundaries have to be periodic. Top and bottom can be closed or open ("solar module'').
</li><li>LHDrad module: It uses long characteristics and is restricted to an equidistant grid and open boundaries at all surfaces (old "supergiant module'').
</li><li>SHORTrad module: It uses short characteristics and is restricted to an equidistant grid and open boundaries at all surfaces (new "supergiant module'').</li></ul>
The code was supplemented with an (optional) MHD version [Schaffenberger et al. (2005)] that can treat magnetic fields. There are also modules for the formation and advection of dust available. The current version now contains the treatment of chemical reaction networks, mostly used for the formation of molecules [Wedemeyer-Böhm et al.

III. Integrated Spectra for Hydrogen-Helium Disks</title><credit>Hubeny, Ivan; Agol, Eric; Blaes, Omer; Krolik, Julian</credit><abstract>We have constructed a grid of non-LTE disk models for a wide range of black hole mass and mass accretion rate, for several values of viscosity parameter alpha, and for two extreme values of the black hole spin: the maximum-rotation Kerr black hole, and the Schwarzschild (non-rotating) black hole. Our procedure calculates self-consistently the vertical structure of all disk annuli together with the radiation field, without any approximations imposed on the optical thickness of the disk, and without any ad hoc approximations to the behavior of the radiation intensity. The total spectrum of a disk is computed by summing the spectra of the individual annuli, taking into account the general relativistic transfer function. The grid covers nine values of the black hole mass between M = 1/8 and 32 billion solar masses with a two-fold increase of mass for each subsequent value; and eleven values of the mass accretion rate, each a power of 2 times 1 solar mass/year. The highest value of the accretion rate corresponds to 0.3 Eddington. We show the vertical structure of individual annuli within the set of accretion disk models, along with their local emergent flux, and discuss the internal physical self-consistency of the models. We then present the full disk-integrated spectra, and discuss a number of observationally interesting properties of the models, such as optical/ultraviolet colors, the behavior of the hydrogen Lyman limit region, polarization, and number of ionizing photons. Our calculations are far from definitive in terms of the input physics, but generally we find that our models exhibit rather red optical/UV colors. Flux discontinuities in the region of the hydrogen Lyman limit are only present in cool, low luminosity models, while hotter models exhibit blueshifted changes in spectral slope.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11016H</bibcode><topic_id>21950</topic_id><views>48</views><site>http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~blaes/habk/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9911317</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.017</ascl_id><title>Occultation and Microlensing</title><credit>Agol, Eric</credit><abstract>Occultation and microlensing are different limits of the same phenomena of one body passing in front of another body. We derive a general exact analytic expression which describes both microlensing and occultation in the case of spherical bodies with a source of uniform brightness and a non-relativistic foreground body. We also compute numerically the case of a source with quadratic limb-darkening. In the limit that the gravitational deflection angle is comparable to the angular size of the foreground body, both microlensing and occultation occur as the objects align. Such events may be used to constrain the size ratio of the lens and source stars, the limb-darkening coefficients of the source star, and the surface gravity of the lens star (if the lens and source distances are known). Application of these results to microlensing during transits in binaries and giant-star microlensing are discussed. These results unify the microlensing and occultation limits and should be useful for rapid model fitting of microlensing, eclipse, and "microccultation" events.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11017A</bibcode><topic_id>21952</topic_id><views>42</views><site>http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/agol/microccult.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207228</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.018</ascl_id><title>Transit of a Spherical Planet of a Stellar Chromosphere which is Geometrically Thin</title><credit>Schlawin, Everett; Agol, Eric; Walkowicz, Lucianne; Covey, Kevin; Lloyd, James P.</credit><abstract>Transit light curves for stellar continua have only one minimum and a "U" shape.

The technique involves a dynamic grid in the lens plane on which the mass distribution of the lens is approximated by a sum of basis functions, one per grid cell. We used the projected mass densities of Plummer spheres as basis functions. A genetic algorithm then determines the mass distribution of the lens by forcing images of a single source, projected back onto the source plane, to coincide as well as possible. Averaging several tens of solutions removes the random fluctuations that are introduced by the reproduction process of genomes in the genetic algorithm and highlights those features common to all solutions. Given the positions of the images and the redshifts of the sources and the lens, we show that the mass of a gravitational lens can be retrieved with an accuracy of a few percent and that, if the sources sufficiently cover the caustics, the mass distribution of the gravitational lens can also be reliably retrieved. A major advantage of the algorithm is that it makes full use of the information contained in the radial images, unlike methods that minimise the residuals of the lens equation, and is thus able to accurately reconstruct also the inner parts of the lens.</abstract><bibcode>2010ascl.soft11021L</bibcode><topic_id>22002</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~jori/page/index.php?n=Physics.Grale</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601124</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1011.022</ascl_id><title>yt: A Multi-Code Analysis Toolkit for Astrophysical Simulation Data</title><credit>Turk, Matthew J.; Smith, Britton D.; Oishi, Jeffrey S.; Skory, Stephen; Skillman, Samuel W.; Abel, Tom; Norman, Michael L.</credit><abstract>yt is an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit.

Hydrogen recombination is computed using the effective multilevel atom method, virtually accounting for an infinite number of excited states. We account for two-photon transitions from 2s and higher levels as well as frequency diffusion in Lyman-alpha with a full radiative transfer calculation. We present a new method to evolve the radiation field simultaneously with the level populations and the free electron fraction.

Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area.

Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size and geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate, age metallicity relation, age velocity dispersion relation and analytic density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to generate a catalog of stars and support is available for a wide range of photometric bands. As a concrete example we implement the Besancon Milky Way model for the disc. For the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock & Johnston (2005). In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that the phase space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST and HERMES.

One of the necessary steps for extracting polarization information in the CMB is reducing contamination from so-called "ambiguous modes" on a masked sky, which contain leakage from the larger E-mode signal. This can be achieved by utilising derivative operators on the real-space Stokes Q and U parameters. This paper presents an algorithm and a software package to perform this procedure on the nearly full sky, i.e., with projects such as the Planck Surveyor and future satellites in mind; in particular, the package can perform finite differences on masked, irregular grids and is applied to a semi-regular spherical pixellization, the HEALPix grid. The formalism reduces to the known finite-difference solutions in the case of a regular grid. We quantify full-sky improvements on the possible bounds on the CMB B-mode signal. We find that in the specific case of E and B-mode separation, there exists a "pole problem" in our formalism which produces signal contamination at very low multipoles l. Several solutions to the "pole problem" are presented; one proposed solution facilitates a calculation of a general Gaussian quadrature scheme, which finds application in calculating accurate harmonic coefficients on the HEALPix sphere. Nevertheless, on a masked sphere the software represents a considerable reduction in B-mode noise from limited sky coverage.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft01009B</bibcode><topic_id>22783</topic_id><views>41</views><site>j.bowyer07@imperial.ac.uk</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0520</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1101.010</ascl_id><title>TOPCAT: Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables</title><credit>Taylor, Mark</credit><abstract>TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well. It understands a number of different astronomically important formats (including FITS and VOTable) and more formats can be added.

It offers a variety of ways to view and analyse tables, including a browser for the cell data themselves, viewers for information about table and column metadata, and facilities for 1-, 2-, 3- and higher-dimensional visualisation, calculating statistics and joining tables using flexible matching algorithms. Using a powerful and extensible Java-based expression language new columns can be defined and row subsets selected for separate analysis. Table data and metadata can be edited and the resulting modified table can be written out in a wide range of output formats.

It is a stand-alone application which works quite happily with no network connection. However, because it uses Virtual Observatory (VO) standards, it can cooperate smoothly with other tools in the VO world and beyond, such as VODesktop, Aladin and ds9. Between 2006 and 2009 TOPCAT was developed within the AstroGrid project, and is offered as part of a standard suite of applications on the AstroGrid web site, where you can find information on several other VO tools.

Traditionally, most methods have employed either a finite inversion or gridding to turn observational lensed galaxy ellipticities into an estimate of the surface mass density of a galaxy cluster. We approach the problem from a different perspective, motivated by the success of multi-scale analysis in smoothed particle hydrodynamics. In PBL, we treat each of the lensed galaxies as a particle and then reconstruct the potential by smoothing over a local kernel with variable smoothing scale. In this way, we can tune a reconstruction to produce constant signal-noise throughout, and maximally exploit regions of high information density. 

PBL is designed to include all lensing observables, including multiple image positions and fluxes from strong lensing, as well as weak lensing signals including shear and flexion. In this paper, however, we describe a shear-only reconstruction, and apply the method to several test cases, including simulated lensing clusters, as well as the well-studied ``Bullet Cluster'' (1E0657-56). In the former cases, we show that PBL is better able to identify cusps and substructures than are grid-based reconstructions, and in the latter case, we show that PBL is able to identify substructure in the Bullet Cluster without even exploiting strong lensing measurements.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft02002D</bibcode><topic_id>22822</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~deb/PBL.htm</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0004</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1102.003</ascl_id><title>GRAVLENS: Computational Methods for Gravitational Lensing</title><credit>Keeton, Charles R.</credit><abstract>Modern applications of strong gravitational lensing require the ability to use precise and varied observational data to constrain complex lens models. Two sets of computational methods for lensing calculations are discussed. The first is a new algorithm for solving the lens equation for general mass distributions. This algorithm makes it possible to apply arbitrarily complicated models to observed lenses. The second is an evaluation of techniques for using observational data including positions, fluxes, and time delays of point-like images, as well as maps of extended images, to constrain models of strong lenses.

We use a publicly available Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampler ('Bayesys'), allowing us to avoid local minima in the likelihood functions. To illustrate the power of the MCMC technique, we simulate three clusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale halo and a set of perturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three light beams through each model to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler to recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations. We find that, for typical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data, the total mass in the Einstein radius is recovered with ~1-5% error according to the considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the galaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple images appear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is generally recovered with a 20% error, largely due to the poorly constrained cut-off radius. Finally, we describe how to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We confirm the ability of strong lensing to constrain the mass profile in the central region of galaxy clusters in this way. Ultimately, such a method applied to strong lensing clusters with a very large number of multiple images may provide unique geometrical constraints on cosmology.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft02004K</bibcode><topic_id>22825</topic_id><views>74</views><site>http://projets.lam.fr/projects/lenstool/wiki</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0048</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1102.005</ascl_id><title>MRLENS: Multi-Resolution methods for gravitational LENSing</title><credit>Starck, Jean-Luc; Pires, Sandrine; Refregier, Alexandre</credit><abstract>The MRLENS package offers a new method for the reconstruction of weak lensing mass maps.

The first code (NBODY1) was based on the simple concepts of a force polynomial combined with individual time steps, where numerical problems due to close encounters were avoided by a softened potential. Fortuitously, the elegant Kustaanheimo-Stiefel two-body regularization soon permitted small star clusters to be studied (NBODY3). Subsequent extensions to unperturbed three-body and four-body regularization proved beneficial in dealing with multiple interactions. Investigations of larger systems became possible with the Ahmad-Cohen neighbor scheme which was used more than 20 years ago for expanding universe models of 4000 galaxies (NBODY2). Combining the neighbor scheme with the regularization procedures enabled more realistic star clusters to be considered (NBODY5). After a period of simulations with no apparent technical progress, chain regularization replaced the treatment of compact subsystems (NBODY3, NBODY5). More recently, the Hermite integration method provided a major advance and has been implemented on the special-purpose HARP computers (NBODY4) together with an alternative version for workstations and supercomputers (NBODY6). These codes also include a variety of algorithms for stellar evolution based on fast lookup functions. The treatment of primordial binaries contains efficient procedures for chaotic two-body motion as well as tidal circularization, and special attention is paid to hierarchical systems and their stability. This family of N-body codes constitutes a powerful tool for dynamical simulations which is freely available to the astronomical community, and the massive effort owes much to collaborators.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft02006A</bibcode><topic_id>22834</topic_id><views>47</views><site>http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111.1333A</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0008441</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1102.007</ascl_id><title>PixeLens: A Portable Modeler of Lensed Quasars</title><credit>Saha, Prasenjit; Williams, Liliya L.

This means that some models for one lens can be ruled out by data on a different lens. We explain using two worked examples. One example models 1115+080 and 1608+656 (time-delay quadruple systems) and 1933+503 (a prospective time-delay system) all together, yielding time-delay predictions for the third lens and a 90% confidence estimate of H<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>=14.6+9.4-1.7 Gyr (H<sub>0</sub>=67+9-26 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup>) assuming ΩM=0.3 and Ω<sub>Λ</sub>=0.7.

Without corrections for the effects of beam convolution and sensitivity to GMC properties, the resulting properties may be severely biased. This is particularly true for extragalactic observations, where resolution and sensitivity effects often bias measured values by 40% or more. We correct for finite spatial and spectral resolutions with a simple deconvolution and we correct for sensitivity biases by extrapolating properties of a GMC to those we would expect to measure with perfect sensitivity. The resulting method recovers the properties of a GMC to within 10% over a large range of resolutions and sensitivities, provided the clouds are marginally resolved with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10. We note that interferometers systematically underestimate cloud properties, particularly the flux from a cloud. The degree of bias depends on the sensitivity of the observations and the (u,v) coverage of the observations. In the Appendix to the paper we present a conservative, new decomposition algorithm for identifying GMCs in molecular-line observations. This algorithm treats the data in physical rather than observational units, does not produce spurious clouds in the presence of noise, and is sensitive to a range of morphologies. As a result, the output of this decomposition should be directly comparable among disparate data sets.

The UV photons energetic enough to ionize hydrogen (hν &gt; 13.6 eV) will create the H II region around the star, but lower energy UV photons escape. These far-UV photons (6 eV &lt; hν &lt; 13.6 eV) are still energetic enough to photodissociate molecules and to ionize low ionization-potential atoms such as carbon, silicon, and sulfur. They thus create a photodissociation region (PDR) just outside the H II region. In aggregate, these PDRs dominates the heating and cooling of the neutral interstellar medium.

New capabilities include the ability to correlate a large number of phase centers in a single correlation pass, the extraction of phase calibration tones, correlation of disparate but overlapping sub-bands, the production of rapidly sampled filterbank and kurtosis data at minimal cost, and many more. The latest version of the code is at least 15% faster than the original, and in certain situations many times this value. Finally, we also present detailed test results validating the correctness of the new code.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft02024D</bibcode><topic_id>22968</topic_id><views>47</views><site>http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/installation</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0885</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1102.025</ascl_id><title>LensPix: Fast MPI full sky transforms for HEALPix</title><credit>Lewis, Antony</credit><abstract>Modelling of the weak lensing of the CMB will be crucial to obtain correct cosmological parameter constraints from forthcoming precision CMB anisotropy observations.

The series expansion in the deflection angle cannot be used to simulate accurate CMB maps, so a pixel remapping must be used. For parameter estimation accounting for the change in the power spectrum but assuming Gaussianity is sufficient to obtain accurate results up to Planck sensitivity using current tools.

Frame-independent equations for scalar and tensor perturbations, which are valid for any value of the background curvature, are obtained straightforwardly from the complete set of equations. We discuss the scalar equations in detail, including the integral solution and relation with the line of sight approach, analytic solutions in the early radiation dominated era, and the numerical solution in the standard CDM model.

ZEUS-MP offers an MHD algorithm that is better suited for multidimensional flows than the ZEUS-2D module by virtue of modifications to the method of characteristics scheme first suggested by Hawley & Stone. This MHD module is shown to compare quite favorably to the TVD scheme described by Ryu et al. ZEUS-MP is the first publicly available ZEUS code to allow the advection of multiple chemical (or nuclear) species. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations are enabled via an implicit flux-limited radiation diffusion (FLD) module. The hydrodynamic, MHD, and FLD modules can be used, singly or in concert, in one, two, or three space dimensions. In addition, so-called 1.5D and 2.5D grids, in which the "half-D'' denotes a symmetry axis along which a constant but nonzero value of velocity or magnetic field is evolved, are supported. Self-gravity can be included either through the assumption of a GM/r potential or through a solution of Poisson's equation using one of three linear solver packages (conjugate gradient, multigrid, and FFT) provided for that purpose. Point-mass potentials are also supported.

Because ZEUS-MP is designed for large simulations on parallel computing platforms, considerable attention is paid to the parallel performance characteristics of each module in the code. Strong-scaling tests involving pure hydrodynamics (with and without self-gravity), MHD, and RHD are performed in which large problems (2563 zones) are distributed among as many as 1024 processors of an IBM SP3. Parallel efficiency is a strong function of the amount of communication required between processors in a given algorithm, but all modules are shown to scale well on up to 1024 processors for the chosen fixed problem size.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft02028H</bibcode><topic_id>22897</topic_id><views>74</views><site>http://www.netpurgatory.com/zeusmp.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..165..188H</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1103.001</ascl_id><title>Difmap: Synthesis Imaging of Visibility Data</title><credit>Shepherd, Martin</credit><abstract>Difmap is a program developed for synthesis imaging of visibility data from interferometer arrays of radio telescopes world-wide.

These simulations require hundreds to thousands of gigabytes of memory, and employ hundreds to tens of thousands of processing cores on many compute nodes. In order to study the distribution of dark matter in a cosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halo finder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in the simulation. The resources required for halo finding are similar to the requirements for the simulation itself. In particular, simulations have become too extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that the computational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiple nodes and cores. Here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method called Parallel HOP for large-scale cosmological simulation data. Based on the halo finder HOP, it utilizes MPI and domain decomposition to distribute the halo finding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of much larger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallel implementations of HOP. We provide a reference implementation of this method as a part of the toolkit yt, an analysis toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data that includes complementary analysis modules. Additionally, we discuss a suite of benchmarks that demonstrate that this method scales well up to several hundred tasks and datasets in excess of $2000^3$ particles. The Parallel HOP method and our implementation can be readily applied to any kind of N-body simulation data and is therefore widely applicable.

C.; Pelupessy, Inti</credit><abstract>SPHRAY, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) ray tracer, is designed to solve the 3D, time dependent, radiative transfer (RT) equations for arbitrary density fields. The SPH nature of SPHRAY makes the incorporation of separate hydrodynamics and gravity solvers very natural. SPHRAY relies on a Monte Carlo (MC) ray tracing scheme that does not interpolate the SPH particles onto a grid but instead integrates directly through the SPH kernels. Given initial conditions and a description of the sources of ionizing radiation, the code will calculate the non-equilibrium ionization state (HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII, e) and temperature (internal energy/entropy) of each SPH particle. The sources of radiation can include point like objects, diffuse recombination radiation, and a background field from outside the computational volume. The MC ray tracing implementation allows for the quick introduction of new physics and is parallelization friendly. A quick Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) test taken from computer graphics applications allows for the acceleration of the raytracing component. We present the algorithms used in SPHRAY and verify the code by performing all the test problems detailed in the recent Radiative Transfer Comparison Project of Iliev et. al.

Because the algorithm populates the cluster with a discrete number of tenable stars, it can be used as part of a Monte Carlo Method to derive the probabilistic range of characteristics (integrated colors, for example) consistent with a given cluster mass and age.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft04004P</bibcode><topic_id>23301</topic_id><views>36</views><site>http://www.physics.uc.edu/~popescu/index_lsst_info</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1113</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4210</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1104.005</ascl_id><title>GALAXEV: Evolutionary Stellar Population Synthesis Models</title><credit>Bruzual, Gustavo; Charlot, Stéphane</credit><abstract>GALAXEV is a library of evolutionary stellar population synthesis models computed using the new isochrone synthesis code of Bruzual & Charlot (2003).

Static simulations are explored for a range of neutron irradiation and temperatures. Dynamic simulations are studied with a parameterized expansion formula. Our code generates the resulting abundance pattern based on a general entropy expression that can be applied to degenerate as well as non-degenerate matter, allowing us to track the rapid density and temperature evolution of the ejecta during the initial stages of ejecta expansion.

The algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: 1.) by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components, and 2.) with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. 2-D models such as the "Nuker'' law, the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions are used. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When examined in detail, even simple-looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately rather than the one or two components more often employed. This is illustrated by way of seven case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft04010P</bibcode><topic_id>23408</topic_id><views>64</views><site>http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204182</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2601</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0731</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1104.011</ascl_id><title>DAOPHOT: Crowded-field Stellar Photometry Package</title><credit>Stetson, Peter B.</credit><abstract>The DAOPHOT program exploits the capability of photometrically linear image detectors to perform stellar photometry in crowded fields.

E. G.; Graves, Genevieve J.</credit><abstract>We present corrections to the Schlegel, Finkbeiner, Davis (SFD98) reddening maps over the Sloan Digital Sky Survey northern Galactic cap area. To find these corrections, we employ what we dub the "standard crayon" method, in which we use passively evolving galaxies as color standards by which to measure deviations from the reddening map. We select these passively evolving galaxies spectroscopically, using limits on the H alpha and O II equivalent widths to remove all star-forming galaxies from the SDSS main galaxy catalog. We find that by correcting for known reddening, redshift, color-magnitude relation, and variation of color with environmental density, we can reduce the scatter in color to below 3% in the bulk of the 151,637 galaxies we select. Using these galaxies we construct maps of the deviation from the SFD98 reddening map at 4.5 degree resolution, with 1-sigma error of ~ 1.5 millimagnitudes E(B-V). We find that the SFD98 maps are largely accurate with most of the map having deviations below 3 millimagnitudes E(B-V), though some regions do deviate from SFD98 by as much as 50%. The maximum deviation found is 45 millimagnitudes in E(B-V), and spatial structure of the deviation is strongly correlated with the observed dust temperature, such that SFD98 underpredicts reddening in regions of low dust temperature. The maps of these deviations, as well as their errors, are made available to the scientific community as supplemental correction to SFD98 at the URL below.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft04014P</bibcode><topic_id>23555</topic_id><views>79</views><site>http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jpeek/dust.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3310</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1105.001</ascl_id><title>STILTS: Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set</title><credit>Taylor, Mark</credit><abstract>The STIL Tool Set is a set of command-line tools based on STIL, the Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library. It deals with the processing of tabular data; the package has been designed for, but is not restricted to, astronomical tables such as object catalogues. Some of the tools are generic and can work with multiple formats (including FITS, VOTable, CSV, SQL and ASCII), and others are specific to the VOTable format. In some ways, STILTS forms the command-line counterpart of the GUI table analysis tool TOPCAT. The package is robust, fully documented, and designed for efficiency, especially with very large datasets. 

Facilities offered include:

These facilities can be put together in very flexible and efficient ways. For tasks in which the data can be streamed, the size of table STILTS can process is effectively unlimited. For other tasks, million-row tables usually do not present a problem. STILTS is written in pure Java (J2SE1.5 or later), and can be run from the command line or from Jython, or embedded into java applications.

Such features allow the user to test the cosmological models by confronting them to BBN constraints.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft06001A</bibcode><topic_id>23897</topic_id><views>72</views><site>http://superiso.in2p3.fr/relic/alterbbn</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1363</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1106.002</ascl_id><title>PHOEBE: PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs</title><credit>Prsa, Andrej; Matijevic, Gal; Latkovic, Olivera; Vilardell, Francesc; Wils, Patrick</credit><abstract>PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) is a modeling package for eclipsing binary stars, built on top of the widely used WD program (Wilson & Devinney 1971).

To help accomplish that task it is organized as a core C library, language bindings for that library, and device drivers which control how the plots are presented in non-interactive and interactive plotting contexts. The PLplot core library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page, and multiple pages are allowed for those device formats that support them. PLplot has core support for Unicode. This means for our many Unicode-aware devices that plots can be labelled using the enormous selection of Unicode mathematical symbols. A large subset of our Unicode-aware devices also support complex text layout (CTL) languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Indic and Indic-derived CTL scripts such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan. PLplot device drivers support a number of different file formats for non-interactive plotting and a number of different platforms that are suitable for interactive plotting. It is easy to add new device drivers to PLplot by writing a small number of device dependent routines.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft06003M</bibcode><topic_id>23920</topic_id><views>38</views><site>http://plplot.sourceforge.net/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ASPC..314..517S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1106.004</ascl_id><title>E3D: The Euro3D Visualization Tool</title><credit>Sánchez, Sebastián F.</credit><abstract>E3D is a package of tools for the analysis and visualization of IFS data.

The package comprises a set of command-line routines adapted for each of these steps, suitable for creating pipelines. The routines have been tested against simulations, and against real data from various integral field spectrographs (PMAS, PPAK, GMOS, VIMOS and INTEGRAL). Particular attention is paid to the treatment of cross-talk.

R3D unifies the reduction techniques for the different IFS instruments to a single one, in order to allow the general public to reduce different instruments data in an homogeneus, consistent and simple way. Although still in its prototyping phase, it has been proved to be useful to reduce PMAS (both in the Larr and the PPAK modes), VIMOS and INTEGRAL data. The current version has been coded in Perl, using PDL, in order to speed-up the algorithm testing phase. Most of the time critical algorithms have been translated to C[float=][/float], and it is our intention to translate all of them. However, even in this phase R3D is fast enough to produce valuable science frames in reasonable time.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft06005S</bibcode><topic_id>23929</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://www.caha.es/sanchez/r3d/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AN....327..850S</ref><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.378..416V</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1106.006</ascl_id><title>MECI: A Method for Eclipsing Component Identification</title><credit>Devor, Jonathan; Charbonneau, David</credit><abstract>We describe an automated method for assigning the most probable physical parameters to the components of an eclipsing binary, using only its photometric light curve and combined colors. With traditional methods, one attempts to optimize a multi-parameter model over many iterations, so as to minimize the chi-squared value. We suggest an alternative method, where one selects pairs of coeval stars from a set of theoretical stellar models, and compares their simulated light curves and combined colors with the observations. This approach greatly reduces the parameter space over which one needs to search, and allows one to estimate the components' masses, radii and absolute magnitudes, without spectroscopic data. We have implemented this method in an automated program using published theoretical isochrones and limb-darkening coefficients. Since it is easy to automate, this method lends itself to systematic analyses of datasets consisting of photometric time series of large numbers of stars, such as those produced by OGLE, MACHO, TrES, HAT, and many others surveys.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft06006D</bibcode><topic_id>23931</topic_id><views>38</views><site>https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~jdevor/MECI/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609588</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1106.007</ascl_id><title>MIRIAD: Multi-channel Image Reconstruction, Image Analysis, and Display</title><credit>Sault, R.

To address this issue, we present SLUG, a new code to "Stochastically Light Up Galaxies". SLUG synthesizes stellar populations using a Monte Carlo technique that treats stochastic sampling properly including the effects of clustering, the stellar initial mass function, star formation history, stellar evolution, and cluster disruption. This code produces many useful outputs, including i) catalogs of star clusters and their properties, such as their stellar initial mass distributions and their photometric properties in a variety of filters, ii) two dimensional histograms of color-magnitude diagrams of every star in the simulation, iii) and the photometric properties of field stars and the integrated photometry of the entire simulated galaxy. After presenting the SLUG algorithm in detail, we validate the code through comparisons with starburst99 in the well-sampled regime, and with observed photometry of Milky Way clusters.

The software is able to simultaneously analyze multiple transits observed in different conditions (instrument, filter, weather, etc). The graphical interface allows for the simple execution and interpretation of Bayesian MCMC analysis tailored to a user's specific data set and has been thoroughly tested on ground-based and Kepler photometry.

By numerically solving the full CMB radiative transport equations, we study the B-mode power spectrum induced by stochastic magnetic fields that have significant power on scales smaller than the thickness of the last scattering surface. Constraints on the magnetic field energy density and inertial scale are derived from WMAP 7-year data, and are stronger than the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound for a range of parameters.

We compare this CS-based deconvolution method with two CLEAN-based deconvolution methods: the Högbom CLEAN and the multiscale CLEAN.

It contains an integrator for the vector contribution to the CMB temperature and polarization. The code is reconfigured to make it easier to use with or without active sources. To produce inflationary CMB spectra one simply sets the string tension to zero (gmu=0.0d0). For a non-zero value of tension only the string contribution is calculated.

An option is added to randomize the directions of velocities of consolidated segments as they evolve in time. In the original segment model, which is still the default version (irandomv=0), each segment is given a random velocity initially, but then continues to move in a straight line for the rest of its life. The new option (irandomv=1) allows to additionally randomize velocities of each segment at roughly each Hubble time. However, the merits of this new option are still under investigation. The default version (irandomv=0) is strongly recommended, since it actually gives reasonable unequal time correlators.

Firstly, the ionization fraction x_e is approximately 10% smaller for redshifts <~800, due to non-equilibrium processes in the excited states of H. Secondly, HeI recombination is much slower than previously thought, and is delayed until just before H recombines. We describe the basic physics behind the new results and present a simple way to reproduce our calculation. This should enable fast computation of the ionization history (and quantities such as the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies which depend on it) for arbitrary cosmologies, without the need to consider the hundreds of atomic levels used in our complete model.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft06026S</bibcode><topic_id>24301</topic_id><views>46</views><site>http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/recfast.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909275</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.001</ascl_id><title>SNID: Supernova Identification</title><credit>Blondin, Stéphane; Tonry, John L.</credit><abstract>We present an algorithm to identify the type of an SN spectrum and to determine its redshift and age. This algorithm, based on the correlation techniques of Tonry & Davis, is implemented in the Supernova Identification (SNID) code. It is used by members of ongoing high-redshift SN searches to distinguish between type Ia and type Ib/c SNe, and to identify "peculiar" SNe Ia. We develop a diagnostic to quantify the quality of a correlation between the input and template spectra, which enables a formal evaluation of the associated redshift error. Furthermore, by comparing the correlation redshifts obtained using SNID with those determined from narrow lines in the SN host galaxy spectrum, we show that accurate redshifts (with a typical error less than 0.01) can be determined for SNe Ia without a spectrum of the host galaxy. Last, the age of an input spectrum is determined with a typical 3-day accuracy, shown here by using high-redshift SNe Ia with well-sampled light curves. The success of the correlation technique confirms the similarity of some SNe Ia at low and high redshifts. The SNID code, which is available to the community, can also be used for comparative studies of SN spectra, as well as comparisons between data and models.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07001B</bibcode><topic_id>24326</topic_id><views>46</views><site>http://people.lam.fr/blondin.stephane/software/snid/index.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4488</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.002</ascl_id><title>GIBIS: Gaia Instrument and Basic Image Simulator</title><credit>Babusiaux, Carine; Sartoretti, Paola; Leclerc, Nicolas; Chéreau, Fabien</credit><abstract>GIBIS is a pixel-level simulator of the Gaia mission.

We make a comparative study of the different theoretical approaches to muon bremsstrahlung and muonic pair production interactions. A detailed algorithm that includes all the relevant characteristics of such processes has been implemented in the AIRES air shower simulation system. We have simulated ultra high energy showers in different conditions in order to measure the influence of these muonic electromagnetic interactions. We have found that during the late stages of the shower development (well beyond the shower maximum) many global observables are significantly modified in relative terms when the mentioned interactions are taken into account. This is most evident in the case of the electromagnetic component of very inclined showers. On the other hand, our simulations indicate that the studied processes do not induce significant changes either in the position of the shower maximum or the structure of the shower front surface.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07006C</bibcode><topic_id>24358</topic_id><views>70</views><site>http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/auger/aires/eg_Aires.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0552</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.007</ascl_id><title>AMUSE: Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment</title><credit>Portegies Zwart, Simon</credit><abstract>AMUSE is an open source software framework for large-scale simulations in astrophysics, in which existing codes for gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics and radiative transport can be easily coupled and placed in the appropriate observational context.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07007P</bibcode><topic_id>24392</topic_id><views>95</views><site>http://www.amusecode.org/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013CoPhC.183..456P</ref><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21813310W</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.008</ascl_id><title>STARS: A Stellar Evolution Code</title><credit>Eggleton, P.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the code we investigate potential progenitors for the Type IIb supernova 1993J, which is believed to have been an interacting binary system prior to its primary exploding. We use our detailed binary stellar evolution code to model this system to determine the possible range of primary and secondary masses that could have produced the observed characteristics of this system, with particular reference to the secondary. Using the luminosities and temperatures for both stars (as determined by Maund et al. 2004) and the remaining mass of the hydrogen envelope of the primary at the time of explosion, we find that if mass transfer is 100 per cent efficient the observations can be reproduced by a system consisting of a 15 solar mass primary and a 14 solar mass secondary in an orbit with an initial period of 2100 days. With a mass transfer efficiency of 50 per cent, a more massive system consisting of a 17 solar mass primary and a 16 solar mass secondary in an initial orbit of 2360 days is needed.

However, it turned out that in REAS2 and all other time-domain models which calculate the radio emission by superposing the radiation of the single air shower electrons and positrons, the calculation of the emission contributions was not fully consistent. In this article, we present a revised implementation in REAS3, which incorporates the missing radio emission due to the variation of the number of charged particles during the air shower evolution using an "end-point formalism". With the inclusion of these emission contributions, the structure of the simulated radio pulses changes from unipolar to bipolar, and the azimuthal emission pattern becomes nearly symmetric. Remaining asymmetries can be explained by radio emission due to the variation of the net charge excess in air showers, which is automatically taken into account in the new implementation. REAS3 constitutes the first self-consistent time-domain implementation based on single particle emission taking the full complexity of air shower physics into account, and is freely available for all interested users.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07009L</bibcode><topic_id>24397</topic_id><views>40</views><site>http://www.timhuege.de/reas</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5343</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1994</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.010</ascl_id><title>XDSPRES: CL-based package for Reducing OSIRIS Cross-dispersed Spectra</title><credit>Ruschel-Dutra, Daniel; Riffel, Rogério; Ducati, Jorge Ricardo; Pastoriza, Miriani</credit><abstract>We present a description of the CL-based package XDSPRES, which aims at being a complete reducing facility for cross-dispersed spectra taken with the Ohio State Infrared Imager/Spectrometer, as installed at the SOAR telescope.

While oriented for large angular size systems (i.e. many pixels), its tools can be applied to any imaging data of any size. The package core contains routines to perform the following critical galaxy photometry functions:

<ul><li>sky determination</li><li>frame cleaning</li><li>ellipse fitting</li><li>profile fitting</li><li>total and isophotal magnitudes</li></ul>

The goal of the package is to provide an automated, assembly-line type of reduction system for galaxy photometry of space-based or ground-based imaging data. The procedures outlined in the documentation are flux independent, thus, these routines can be used for non-optical data as well as typical imaging datasets.

ARCHANGEL has been tested on several current OS's (RedHat Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X). A tarball for installation is available at the download page. The main routines are Python and FORTRAN based, therefore, a current installation of Python and a FORTRAN compiler are required. The ARCHANGEL package also contains Python hooks to the PGPLOT package, an XML processor and network tools which automatically link to data archives (i.e. NED, HST, 2MASS, etc) to download images in a non-interactive manner.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07011S</bibcode><topic_id>24405</topic_id><views>82</views><site>http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/archangel/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703646</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1728</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.012</ascl_id><title>LIME: Flexible, Non-LTE Line Excitation and Radiation Transfer Method for Millimeter and Far-infrared Wavelengths</title><credit>Brinch, C.; Hogerheijde, M.

The code works in arbitrary three dimensional geometry using unstructured Delaunay latices for the transport of photons. Various physical models can be used as input, ranging from analytical descriptions over tabulated models to SPH simulations. To generate the Delaunay grid we sample the input model randomly, but weigh the sample probability with the molecular density and other parameters, and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scales with the local opacity. Slow convergence of opaque models becomes traceable; when convergence between the level populations, the radiation field, and the point separation has been obtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images that can readily be compared to observations. LIME is particularly well suited for modeling of ALMA data because of the high dynamic range in scales that can be resolved using this type of grid, and can furthermore deal with overlapping lines of multiple molecular and atomic species.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07012B</bibcode><topic_id>24421</topic_id><views>81</views><site>http://www.nbi.dk/~brinch/lime.php</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1492</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.013</ascl_id><title>CASA: Common Astronomy Software Applications</title><credit>International Consortium Of Scientists</credit><abstract>CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications package, is being developed with the primary goal of supporting the data post-processing needs of the next generation of radio astronomical telescopes such as ALMA and EVLA.

The algorithm works by first contouring the data at a multiple of the rms noise of the observations, then searches for peaks of emission which locate the clumps, and then follows them down to lower intensities. No a proiri clump profile is assumed. By creating simulated data, we test the performance of the algorithm and show that a contour map most accurately depicts internal structure at a contouring interval equal to twice the rms noise of the map. Blending of clump emission leads to small errors in mass and size determinations and in severe cases can result in a number of clumps being misidentified as a single unit, flattening the measured clump mass spectrum. The algorithm is applied to two real data sets as an example of its use. The Rosette molecular cloud is a 'typical' star-forming cloud, but in the Maddalena molecular cloud high-mass star formation is completely absent. Comparison of the two clump lists generated by the algorithm show that on a one-to-one basis the clumps in the star-forming cloud have higher peak temperatures, higher average densities, and are more gravitationally bound than in the non-star-forming cloud. Collective properties of the clumps, such as temperature-size-line-width-mass relations appear very similar, however. Contrary to the initial results reported in a previous paper (Williams & Blitz 1993), we find that the current, more thoroughly tested analysis finds no significant difference in the clump mass spectrum of the two clouds.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft07014W</bibcode><topic_id>24436</topic_id><views>89</views><site>http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/jpw/clumpfind.shtml</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...428..693W</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1107.015</ascl_id><title>McLuster: A Tool to Make a Star Cluster</title><credit>Kuepper, A.

Several such uses of ground-based data, especially weak gravitational lensing, require highly precise measurements of galaxy image statistics with careful correction for the effects of the point-spread function (PSF). The SHERA (SHEar Reconvolution Analysis) software  simulates ground-based imaging data with realistic galaxy morphologies and observing conditions, starting from space-based data (from COSMOS, the Cosmological Evolution Survey) and accounting for the effects of the space-based PSF. This code simulates ground-based data, optionally with a weak lensing shear applied, in a model-independent way using a general Fourier space formalism. The utility of this pipeline is that it allows for a precise, realistic assessment of systematic errors due to the method of data processing, for example in extracting weak lensing galaxy shape measurements or galaxy radial profiles, given user-supplied observational conditions and real galaxy morphologies. Moreover, the simulations allow for the empirical test of error estimates and determination of parameter degeneracies, via generation of many noise maps.

It is of a type of model known as “semi-analytic” in which the numerous complex non-linear physics involved are solved using a combination of analytic approximations and empirical calibrations from more detailed, numerical solutions. Models of this type aim to begin with the initial state of the Universe (specified shortly after the Big Bang) and apply physical principles to determine the properties of galaxies in the Universe at later times, including the present day. Typical properties computed include the mass of stars and gas in each galaxy, broad structural properties (e.g. radii, rotation speeds, geometrical shape etc.), dark matter and black hole contents, and observable quantities such as luminosities, chemical composition etc.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft08004B</bibcode><topic_id>24754</topic_id><views>40</views><site>https://sites.google.com/site/galacticusmodel/</site><site>https://launchpad.net/galacticus</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1786</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4098</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1108.005</ascl_id><title>Gaepsi: Gadget Visualization Tookit</title><credit>Feng, Yu; Croft, Rupert A.

Visualization is the most important facet of Gaepsi, but it also allows data analysis on GADGET simulations with its growing number of physics related subroutines and constants. Unlike mesh based scheme, SPH simulations are directly visible in the sense that a splatting process is required to produce raster images from the simulations. Gaepsi produces images of 2-dimensional line-of-sight projections of the simulation. Scalar fields and vector fields are both supported.

Besides the traditional way of slicing a simulation, Gaepsi also has built-in support of 'Survey-like' domain transformation proposed by Carlson & White. An improved implementation is used in Gaepsi. Gaepsi both implements an interactive shell for plotting and exposes its API for batch processing. When complied with OpenMP, Gaepsi automatically takes the advantage of the multi-core computers. In interactive mode, Gaepsi is capable of producing images of size up to 32000 x 32000 pixels. The user can zoom, pan and rotate the field with a command in on the finger tip. The interactive mode takes full advantages of matplotlib's rich annotating, labeling and image composition facilities. There are also built-in commands to add objects that are commonly used in cosmology simulations to the figures.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft08005F</bibcode><topic_id>24756</topic_id><views>50</views><site>https://github.com/rainwoodman/gaepsi/wiki</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1255</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1108.006</ascl_id><title>STARLIGHT: Spectral Synthesis Code</title><credit>Cid Fernandes, R.; Mateus, A.; Sodré, L.; Stasinska, G.; Gomes, J.

Most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z_spec) = 0.08 up to z&lt;6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The results obtained are more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft08011B</bibcode><topic_id>24765</topic_id><views>75</views><site>http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/~txitxo/bayesian.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811189</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1108.012</ascl_id><title>TITAN: General-purpose Radiation Hydrodynamics Code</title><credit>Laboratory For Computational Astrophysics</credit><abstract>TITAN is a general-purpose radiation hydrodynamics code developed at the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (NCSA, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign).

We take inspiration from recent progress in understanding solar wind acceleration to develop a physically motivated model of the time-steady mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars and evolved giants. This model follows the energy flux of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from a subsurface convection zone to its eventual dissipation and escape through open magnetic flux tubes. We show how Alfven waves and turbulence can produce winds in either a hot corona or a cool extended chromosphere, and we specify the conditions that determine whether or not coronal heating occurs. These models do not utilize arbitrary normalization factors, but instead predict the mass loss rate directly from a star's fundamental properties. We take account of stellar magnetic activity by extending standard age-activity-rotation indicators to include the evolution of the filling factor of strong photospheric magnetic fields. We compared the predicted mass loss rates with observed values for 47 stars and found significantly better agreement than was obtained from the popular scaling laws of Reimers, Schroeder, and Cuntz. The algorithm used to compute cool-star mass loss rates is provided as a self-contained and efficient IDL computer code.

It uses Bayesian techniques to explore multidimensional SUSY parameter spaces and to compare SUSY predictions with observable quantities, including sparticle masses, collider observables, dark matter abundance, direct detection cross sections, indirect detection quantities etc. Scanning can be performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technology or even more efficiently by employing a new scanning technique called, MultiNest. which implements the nested sampling algorithm. Using MultiNest, a full 8-dimensional scan of the CMSSM takes about 12 hours on 10 2.4GHz CPUs. There is also an option for old-style fixed-grid scanning. A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/superbayes-users">discussion forum for SuperBayeS</a> is available.

The package combines SoftSusy, DarkSusy, FeynHiggs, Bdecay, MultiNest and MicrOMEGAs. Some of the routines and the plotting tools are based on <a href="http://ascl.net/1106.025">CosmoMC</a>.

SuperBayeS comes with SuperEGO, a MATLAB graphical user interface tool for interactive plotting of the results.

J.; Huterer, D.; Starkman, G. D.</credit><abstract>We propose a novel representation of cosmic microwave anisotropy maps, where each multipole order l is represented by l unit vectors pointing in directions on the sky and an overall magnitude. These "multipole vectors and scalars" transform as vectors under rotations. Like the usual spherical harmonics, multipole vectors form an irreducible representation of the proper rotation group SO(3). However, they are related to the familiar spherical harmonic coefficients, alm, in a nonlinear way, and are therefore sensitive to different aspects of the CMB anisotropy. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to determine the multipole vectors for a given CMB map and we present an algorithm to compute them. Using the WMAP full-sky maps, we perform several tests of the hypothesis that the CMB anisotropy is statistically isotropic and Gaussian random. We find that the result from comparing the oriented area of planes defined by these vectors between multipole pairs 2&lt;=l1!=l2&lt;=8 is inconsistent with the isotropic Gaussian hypothesis at the 99.4% level for the ILC map and at 98.9% level for the cleaned map of Tegmark et al. A particular correlation is suggested between the l=3 and l=8 multipoles, as well as several other pairs. This effect is entirely different from the now familiar planarity and alignment of the quadrupole and octupole: while the aforementioned is fairly unlikely, the multipole vectors indicate correlations not expected in Gaussian random skies that make them unusually likely. The result persists after accounting for pixel noise and after assuming a residual 10% dust contamination in the cleaned WMAP map. While the definitive analysis of these results will require more work, we hope that multipole vectors will become a valuable tool for various cosmological tests, in particular those of cosmic isotropy.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft09008C</bibcode><topic_id>25233</topic_id><views>31</views><site>http://www.phys.cwru.edu/projects/mpvectors/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310511</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1109.009</ascl_id><title>CMBquick: Spectrum and Bispectrum of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</title><credit>Pitrou, Cyril</credit><abstract>CMBquick is a package for Mathematica in which tools are provided to compute the spectrum and bispectrum of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). It is unavoidably slow, but the main goal is not to design a tool which can be used for systematic exploration of parameters in cosmology, but rather a toy CMB code which is transparent and easily modified. Considering this, the name chosen is nothing but a joke which refers to the widely spread and used softwares <a href="http://ascl.net/9909.004">CMBFAST</a>, <a href="http://ascl.net/1102.026">CAMB</a> or CMBeasy, which should be used for serious and heavy first order CMB computations, and which are indeed very fast.

The package CMBquick is unavoidably slow when it comes to compute the multipoles Cls, and most of it is due to the access time for variables which in Mathematica is approximately ten times slower than in C or Fortran. CMBquick is thus approximately 10 times slower than CAMB and cannot be used for the same reasons. It uses the same method as CAMB for computing the CMB spectrum, which is based on the line of sight approach. However the integration is performed in a different gauge with different time steps and k-spacing. It benefits from the power of Mathematica on numerical resolution of stiff differential systems, and the transfer functions can be obtained with exquisite accuracy.

The purpose of CMBquick is thus twofold. First, CMBquick is a slow but precise and pedagogical, tool which can be used to explore and modify the physical content of the linear and non-linear dynamics. Second, it is a tool which can help developing templates for nonlinear computations, which could then be hard coded once their correctness is checked. The number of equations for non-linear dynamics is quite sizable and CMBquick makes it easy (but slow) to manipulate the non-linear equations, to solve them precisely, and to plot them.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft09009P</bibcode><topic_id>25237</topic_id><views>82</views><site>http://www2.iap.fr/users/pitrou/cmbquick.htm</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1822</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1109.010</ascl_id><title>PyModelFit: Model-fitting Framework and GUI Tool</title><credit>Tollerud, Erik</credit><abstract>PyModelFit provides a pythonic, object-oriented framework that simplifies the task of designing numerical models to fit data.

We start with a root node containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles, until each of the nodes contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate of the local density and its shape provides an estimate of the variance. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We use this method to determine the appropriate metric at each point in space and then use kernel-based methods for calculating the density. The kernel-smoothed estimates were found to be more accurate and have lower dispersion. We apply this method to determine the phase-space densities of dark matter haloes obtained from cosmological N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume distribution function v(f) of phase-space density f does not have a constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase-space densities. We demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of v(f) versus f relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main halo separately roughly reproduces the behaviour as seen in simulations. The use of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase-space densities, but can be used as a general purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft09012S</bibcode><topic_id>25307</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://sourceforge.net/projects/enbid/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.373.1293S</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3659</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1109.013</ascl_id><title>CULSP: Fast Calculation of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram Using Graphics Processing Units</title><credit>Townsend, R.

An automatic iterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to best represent the SEDs of real galaxies at different redshifts; (2.) A training set of spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample; and (3.)

Most FITS readers and converters do not do a proper job at converting FITS image data to 8 bits. 8-bit images stored in JPEG, PNG or TIFF files have the intensities implicitely stored in a non-linear way. Most current FITS image viewers and converters provide the user an incorrect translation of the FITS image content by simply rescaling linearly input pixel values. A first consequence is that the people working on astronomical images usually have to apply narrow intensity cuts or square-root or logarithmic intensity transformations to actually see something on their deep-sky images. A less obvious consequence is that colors obtained by combining images processed this way are not consistent across such a large range of surface brightnesses. Though with other software the user is generally afforded a choice of nonlinear transformations to apply in order to make the faint stuff stand out more clearly in the images, with the limited selection of choices provides, colors will not be accurately rendered, and some manual tweaking will be necessary. The purpose of STIFF is to produce beautiful pictures in an automatic and consistent way.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft10006B</bibcode><topic_id>25550</topic_id><views>73</views><site>http://www.astromatic.net/software/stiff</site><ref>http://www.eso.org/sci/php/meetings/adass2011/html/display.php?topic=Oral_Bertin_1313966778.html</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1110.007</ascl_id><title>GammaLib: Toolbox for High-level Analysis of Astronomical Gamma-ray Data</title><credit>Knödlseder, J.</credit><abstract>The GammaLib is a versatile toolbox for the high-level analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data.

It displays in 3D the particles positions of the different components of an nbody snapshot. It quickly gives a lot of information about the data (shape, density area, formation of structures such as spirals, bars, or peanuts). It allows for in/out zooms, rotations, changes of scale, translations, selection of different groups of particles and plots in different blending colors. It can color particles according to their density or temperature, play with the density threshold, trace orbits, display different time steps, take automatic screenshots to make movies, select particles using the mouse, and fly over a simulation using a given camera path. All these features are accessible from a very intuitive graphic user interface. 

Glnemo2 supports a wide range of input file formats (Nemo, Gadget 1 and 2, phiGrape, Ramses, list of files, realtime gyrfalcON simulation) which are automatically detected at loading time without user intervention. Glnemo2 uses a plugin mechanism to load the data, so that it is easy to add a new file reader. It's powered by a 3D engine which uses the latest OpenGL technology, such as shaders (glsl), vertex buffer object, frame buffer object, and takes in account the power of the graphic card used in order to accelerate the rendering. With a fast GPU, millions of particles can be rendered in real time. Glnemo2 runs on Linux, Windows (using minGW compiler), and MaxOSX, thanks to the QT4API.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft10008L</bibcode><topic_id>25563</topic_id><views>46</views><site>http://projects.oamp.fr/projects/glnemo2</site><ref>http://www.eso.org/sci/php/meetings/adass2011/html/display.php?topic=Focus_Lambert_1315915297.html</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1110.009</ascl_id><title>AAOGlimpse: Three-dimensional Data Viewer</title><credit>Shortridge, Keith</credit><abstract>AAOGlimpse is an experimental display program that uses OpenGL to display FITS data (and even JPEG images) as 3D surfaces that can be rotated and viewed from different angles, all in real-time.

This is in particular the case whenever data to be analyzed are distributed over the sphere or a set of corresponding mock data sets has to be generated. In many of those contexts, rapidly improving resolutions of both the data and simulations puts increasingly bigger emphasis on our ability to calculate the transforms quickly and reliably. 

The scalable spherical harmonic transform library S2HAT consists of a set of flexible, massively parallel, and scalable routines for calculating diverse (scalar, spin-weighted, etc) spherical harmonic transforms for a class of isolatitude sky grids or pixelizations. The library routines implement the standard algorithm with the complexity of O(n^3/2), where n is a number of pixels/grid points on the sphere, however, owing to their efficient parallelization and advanced numerical implementation, they achieve very competitive performance and near perfect scalability. S2HAT is written in Fortran 90 with a C interface. This software is a derivative of the spherical harmonic transforms included in the <a href="http://ascl.net/1107.018">HEALPix package</a> and is based on both serial and MPI routines of its version 2.01, however, since version 2.5 this software is fully autonomous of HEALPix and can be compiled and run without the HEALPix library.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft10013S</bibcode><topic_id>25565</topic_id><views>51</views><site>http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/Recherche/Adamis/MIDAS09/software/s2hat/s2hat.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...556A.109F</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1110.014</ascl_id><title>pureS2HAT: S 2HAT-based Pure E/B Harmonic Transforms</title><credit>Grain, J.; Stompor, R.; Tristram, M.</credit><abstract>The pS2HAT routines allow efficient, parallel calculation of the so-called 'pure' polarized multipoles. The computed multipole coefficients are equal to the standard pseudo-multipoles calculated for the apodized sky maps of the Stokes parameters Q and U subsequently corrected by so-called counterterms. If the applied apodizations fullfill certain boundary conditions, these multipoles correspond to the pure multipoles. Pure multipoles of one type, i.e., either E or B, are ensured not to contain contributions from the other one, at least to within numerical artifacts. They can be therefore further used in the estimation of the sky power spectra via the pseudo power spectrum technique, which has to however correctly account for the applied apodization on the one hand, and the presence of the counterterms, on the other. 

In addition, the package contains the routines permitting calculation of the spin-weighted apodizations, given an input scalar, i.e., spin-0 window. The former are needed to compute the counterterms. It also provides routines for maps and window manipulations. The routines are written in C and based on the <a href="http://ascl.net/1110.013">S2HAT library</a>, which is used to perform all required spherical harmonic transforms as well as all inter-processor communication. They are therefore parallelized using MPI and follow the distributed-memory computational model.

REBOUND comes with three symplectic integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic epicycle integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping (WH). It supports open, periodic and shearing-sheet boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut tree to calculate both self-gravity and collisions.

The faintness of the B-mode signal that these experiments seek to measure requires them to gather enormous data sets.

We make use of high-redshift SN data when training the model, allowing us to extend it bluer than rest-frame U. This increases the utility of our high-redshift SN observations by allowing us to use more of the available data. We find that when the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription, applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description. SiFTO therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies different stretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter and the stretch in the rest-frame B band. SiFTO has been compared to other published light-curve models by applying them to the same set of SN photometry, and it's been demonstrated that SiFTO and SALT2 perform better than the alternatives when judged by the scatter around the best-fit luminosity distance relationship.

A fast turn-around cycle between data retrieval and the production of science-ready products was demonstrated during the Herschel Science Demonstration Phase Initial Results Workshop held 7 months after launch, which is a clear proof that the system has reached a good level of maturity.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft11001H</bibcode><topic_id>25801</topic_id><views>71</views><site>http://herschel.esac.esa.int/HIPE_download.shtml</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ASPC..434..139O</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1111.002</ascl_id><title>CRBLASTER: A Parallel-Processing Computational Framework for Embarrassingly-Parallel Image-Analysis Algorithms</title><credit>Mighell, Kenneth John</credit><abstract>The development of parallel-processing image-analysis codes is generally a challenging task that requires complicated choreography of interprocessor communications. If, however, the image-analysis algorithm is embarrassingly parallel, then the development of a parallel-processing implementation of that algorithm can be a much easier task to accomplish because, by definition, there is little need for communication between the compute processes. I describe the design, implementation, and performance of a parallel-processing image-analysis application, called CRBLASTER, which does cosmic-ray rejection of CCD (charge-coupled device) images using the embarrassingly-parallel L.A.COSMIC algorithm. CRBLASTER is written in C using the high-performance computing industry standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. The code has been designed to be used by research scientists who are familiar with C as a parallel-processing computational framework that enables the easy development of parallel-processing image-analysis programs based on embarrassingly-parallel algorithms. The CRBLASTER source code is freely available at the official application website at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Removing cosmic rays from a single 800x800 pixel Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 image takes 44 seconds with the IRAF script lacos_im.cl running on a single core of an Apple Mac Pro computer with two 2.8-GHz quad-core Intel Xeon processors. CRBLASTER is 7.4 times faster processing the same image on a single core on the same machine. Processing the same image with CRBLASTER simultaneously on all 8 cores of the same machine takes 0.875 seconds -- which is a speedup factor of 50.3 times faster than the IRAF script. A detailed analysis is presented of the performance of CRBLASTER using between 1 and 57 processors on a low-power Tilera 700-MHz 64-core TILE64 processor.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft11002M</bibcode><topic_id>25802</topic_id><views>44</views><site>http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/mighell/crblaster/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2192</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1111.003</ascl_id><title>Saada: A Generator of Astronomical Database</title><credit>Michel, L.</credit><abstract>Saada transforms a set of heterogeneous FITS files or VOtables of various categories (images, tables, spectra, etc.) in a powerful database deployed on the Web.

Most data visualization packages are designed for the display of gridded data, and hence are unsuitable for use with particle data. Therefore, a special package was built that could easily perform the following functions:
<ul><li>Display particle positions (as points), and velocities (as line segments) from an arbitrary viewpoint.</li><li>Zoom in to a chosen position. Due to their extremely clustered nature, structure of interest in an N-body simulation is often so small that it can not be seen when looking at the simulation as a whole.</li><li>Color particles to display scalar fields. Examples of such fields are potential energy, or for SPH particles, density and temperature.</li><li>Selection of a subset of the particles for display and analysis. Regions of interest are generally small subsets of the simulation.</li><li>Following selected particles from one timestep to another.</li><li>Finding cumulative properties of a collection of particles. This usually involves just a sum over the particles. </li></ul>The basic data structure is an array of particle structures. Since TIPSY was built for use with cosmological N-body simulations, there are actually three separate arrays for each of the types of particle used in such simulations: collisionless particles, SPH particles, and star particles. A single timestep is read into these arrays from a disk file. Display is done by finding the x and y coordinates of the particles in the rotated coordinate system, and storing them in arrays. Screen coordinates are calculated from these arrays according to the current zoom factor. Also, a software Z-buffer is maintained to save time if many particles project to the same screen pixel. There are several types of display. An "all plot" displays all particles colored according to their type. A "radial plot" will color particles according to the projection of the velocity along the line-of-sight. A "gas plot" will color gas according to SPH quantities such as density, temperature, neutral hydrogen fraction, etc. Subsets of particles are maintained using boxes." A box structure contains a bounding box, and an array of pointers to particles within the box. All display and analysis functions are performed on the "active box." By default all particles are loaded into box 0, which becomes the active box. If a new timestep is read from disk, all boxes are destroyed. A selection of particles can be followed between timesteps via a "mark" array. Marked particles are displayed in a different color, and the analysis functions can be told to only operate on the marked particles.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft11015N</bibcode><topic_id>26030</topic_id><views>51</views><site>http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/tipsy/tipsy.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...562..605F</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1112.001</ascl_id><title>Eclipse: ESO C Library for an Image Processing Software Environment</title><credit>Devillard, Nicolas</credit><abstract>Written in ANSI C, eclipse is a library offering numerous services related to astronomical image processing: FITS data access, various image and cube loading methods, binary image handling and filtering (including convolution and morphological filters), 2-D cross-correlation, connected components, cube and image arithmetic, dead pixel detection and correction, object detection, data extraction, flat-fielding with robust fit, image generation, statistics, photometry, image-space resampling, image combination, and cube stacking.

Therefore, it is fundamental to find the most direct and faithful way to compare such observational data with hydrodynamical simulations of cluster-like objects, which can currently include various complex physical processes. Here, we present and analyse synthetic Suzaku observations of two cluster-size haloes obtained by processing with PHOX the hydrodynamical simulation of the large-scale, filament-like region in which they reside. Taking advantage of the simulated data, we test the results inferred from the X-ray analysis of the mock observations against the underlying, known solution. Remarkably, we are able to recover the theoretical temperature distribution of the two haloes by means of the multi-temperature fitting of the synthetic spectra.

Wavelets are particularly well-suited to the analysis and denoising of cosmological data, but a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform does not currently exist to analyse spherical 3D data. We present a new fast Discrete Spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform (DSFBT) based on both a discrete Bessel Transform and the HEALPIX angular pixelisation scheme. We tested the 3D wavelet transform and as a toy-application, applied a denoising algorithm in wavelet space to the Virgo large box cosmological simulations and found we can successfully remove noise without much loss to the large scale structure. The new spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform, called MRS3D, is ideally suited to analysing and denoising future 3D spherical cosmological surveys; it uses a novel discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform. MRS3D is based on two packages, IDL and Healpix and can be used only if these two packages have been installed.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft12010L</bibcode><topic_id>26192</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://jstarck.free.fr/mrs3d.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0561</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1112.011</ascl_id><title>CMBview: A Mac OS X program for viewing HEALPix-format sky map data on a sphere</title><credit>Portsmouth, Jamie</credit><abstract>CMBview is a viewer for FITS files containing HEALPix sky maps.

In many cases, a simple tool doing just one task, and doing it right, is all one wishes. In this spirit we introduce CORA, a line fitting tool based on the maximum likelihood technique, which has been developed for the analysis of emission line spectra with low count numbers and has successfully been used in several publications. CORA uses a rigorous application of Poisson statistics. From the assumption of Poissonian noise we derive the probability for a model of the emission line spectrum to represent the measured spectrum. The likelihood function is used as a criterion for optimizing the parameters of the theoretical spectrum and a fixed point equation is derived allowing an efficient way to obtain line fluxes. As an example we demonstrate the functionality of the program with an X-ray spectrum of Capella obtained with the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) on board the Chandra observatory and choose the analysis of the Ne IX triplet around 13.5 Å.</abstract><bibcode>2011ascl.soft12012N</bibcode><topic_id>26206</topic_id><views>42</views><site>http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Ness/Cora/index.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AN....323..129N</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1112.013</ascl_id><title>XEphem: Interactive Astronomical Ephemeris</title><credit>Downey, Elwood Charles</credit><abstract>XEphem is a scientific-grade interactive astronomical ephemeris package for UNIX-like systems.

Due to the interaction between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics, it is difficult to solve for the evolution of both systems in a completely self-consistent way. The trajectories of stars are computed using a block timestep scheme, as described earlier. Stellar and binary evolution is updated at fixed intervals (every 1/64 of a crossing time, typically a few thousand years). Any feedback between the two systems may thus experience a delay of at most one timestep. Internal evolution time steps may differ for each star and binary, and depend on binary period, perturbations due to neighbors, and the evolutionary state of the star. Time steps in this treatment vary from several milliseconds up to (at most) a million years.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft01003P</bibcode><topic_id>26375</topic_id><views>48</views><site>http://www.sns.ias.edu/~starlab/seba/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6125</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1201.004</ascl_id><title>emGain: Determination of EM gain of CCD</title><credit>Daigle, Olivier; Carignan, Claude; Blais-Ouellette, Sebastien</credit><abstract>The determination of the EM gain of the CCD is best done by fitting the histogram of many low-light frames.

A suite of nuclear reaction models has been implemented into a single code system, enabling one to evaluate basically all nuclear reactions beyond the resonance range. In particular, TALYS estimates the Maxwellian-averaged reaction rates that are of astrophysical relevance. This enables reaction rates to be calculated with increased accuracy and reliability and the approximations of previous codes to be investigated. The TALYS predictions for the thermonuclear rates of relevance to astrophysics are detailed and compared with those derived by widely-used codes for the same nuclear ingredients. TALYS predictions may differ significantly from those of previous codes, in particular for nuclei for which no or little nuclear data is available. The pre-equilibrium process is shown to influence the astrophysics rates of exotic neutron-rich nuclei significantly.

R.; Gieles, Mark</credit><abstract>The star cluster evolution code Evolve Me A Cluster of StarS (EMACSS) is a simple yet physically motivated computational model that describes the evolution of some fundamental properties of star clusters in static tidal fields. The prescription is based upon the flow of energy within the cluster, which is a constant fraction of the total energy per half-mass relaxation time. According to Henon's predictions, this flow is independent of the precise mechanisms for energy production within the core, and therefore does not require a complete description of the many-body interactions therein. Dynamical theory and analytic descriptions of escape mechanisms is used to construct a series of coupled differential equations expressing the time evolution of cluster mass and radius for a cluster of equal-mass stars. These equations are numerically solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration kernel; the results were benchmarked against a data base of direct N-body simulations. EMACSS is publicly available and reproduces the N-body results to within ~10 per cent accuracy for the entire post-collapse evolution of star clusters.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft03006A</bibcode><topic_id>28139</topic_id><views>42</views><site>http://arxiv.org/src/1203.4744v1/anc</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4744</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1203.007</ascl_id><title>EBTEL: Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops</title><credit>Klimchuk, J. A.; Patsourakos, S.; Cargill, P. J.</credit><abstract>Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and 1D hydro codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so "0D models" are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) that accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly upon earlier models of this type--in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydro simulations despite using four orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft03007K</bibcode><topic_id>28140</topic_id><views>42</views><site>http://asterisk.apod.com/download/file.php?id=6646</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K</ref><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4819</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1203.008</ascl_id><title>MegaLUT: Correcting ellipticity measurements of galaxies</title><credit>Tewes, Malte; Cantale, Nicolas; Courbin, Frédéric; Kitching, Thomas; Meylan, Georges</credit><abstract>MegaLUT is a simple and fast method to correct ellipticity measurements of galaxies from the distortion by the instrumental and atmospheric point spread function (PSF), in view of weak lensing shear measurements.

Of particular interest is the efficiency of the method, with a processing time below 3 ms per galaxy on an ordinary CPU.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft03008T</bibcode><topic_id>28148</topic_id><views>44</views><site>http://lastro.epfl.ch/megalut</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4429</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1203.009</ascl_id><title>MYRIAD: N-body code for simulations of star clusters</title><credit>Konstantinidis, Simos; Kokkotas, Kostas D.</credit><abstract>MYRIAD is a C++ code for collisional N-body simulations of star clusters. The code uses the Hermite fourth-order scheme with block time steps, for advancing the particles in time, while the forces and neighboring particles are computed using the GRAPE-6 board. Special treatment is used for close encounters, binary and multiple sub-systems that either form dynamically or exist in the initial configuration. The structure of the code is modular and allows the appropriate treatment of more physical phenomena, such as stellar and binary evolution, stellar collisions and evolution of close black-hole binaries. Moreover, it can be easily modified so that the part of the code that uses GRAPE-6 could be replaced by another module that uses other accelerating-hardware like the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Appropriate choice of the free parameters give a good accuracy and speed for simulations of star clusters up to and beyond core collapse. The code accuracy becomes comparable and even better than the accuracy of existing codes when a number of close binary systems is dynamically created in a simulation; this is due to the high accuracy of the method that is used for close binary and multiple sub-systems. The code can be used for evolving star clusters containing equal-mass stars or star clusters with an initial mass function (IMF) containing an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) at the center and/or a fraction of primordial binaries, which are systems of particular astrophysical interest.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft03009K</bibcode><topic_id>28149</topic_id><views>37</views><site>http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~tat/MYRIAD.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3326</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1203.010</ascl_id><title>Youpi: YOUr processing PIpeline</title><credit>Monnerville, Mathias; Sémah, Gregory</credit><abstract>Youpi is a portable, easy to use web application providing high level functionalities to perform data reduction on scientific FITS images.

Angular momentum transport is not only implemented for standard coordinate systems with rotational symmetry (i.e. cylindrical, spherical) but also for a general set of orthogonal coordinate systems allowing the use of exotic curvilinear meshes (e.g. oblate-spheroidal).

Mass segregation stands as one of the most robust features of the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating star clusters. We formulate parametrized models of mass segregated star clusters in virial equilibrium. To this purpose we introduce mean inter-particle potentials for statistically described unsegregated systems and suggest a single-parameter generalization of its form which gives a mass-segregated state. Plumix is a numerical C-code generating the cluster according the algorithm given for construction of appropriate star cluster models. Their stability over several crossing-times is verified by following the evolution by means of direct N-body integration.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06007S</bibcode><topic_id>28954</topic_id><views>37</views><site>http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/en/download/software/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.385.1673S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.008</ascl_id><title>Catena: Ensemble of stars orbit integration</title><credit>Pflamm-Altenburg, Jan</credit><abstract>Catena integrates the orbits of an ensemble of stars using the chain-regularization method (Mikkola & Aarseth) with an embedded Runge-Kutta integration method of 9(8)th order (Prince & Dormand).</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06008P</bibcode><topic_id>28955</topic_id><views>48</views><site>http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/en/download/software/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.373..295P</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.009</ascl_id><title>Libimf</title><credit>Pflamm-Altenburg, Jan</credit><abstract>Libimf provides a collection of programming functions based on the general IMF-algorithm by Pflamm-Altenburg & Kroupa (2006).</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06009P</bibcode><topic_id>28956</topic_id><views>34</views><site>http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/en/download/software/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.373..295P</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.010</ascl_id><title>mkj_libs: Helper routines for plane-fitting & analysis tools</title><credit>Metz, Manuel</credit><abstract>mkj_libs provides a set of helper routines (vector operations, astrometry, statistical analysis of spherical data) for the main plane-fitting and analysis tools.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06010M</bibcode><topic_id>28957</topic_id><views>41</views><site>http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/en/download/software/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.374.1125M</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.011</ascl_id><title>Double Eclipsing Binary Fitting</title><credit>Cagas, P.; Pejcha, O.</credit><abstract>The parameters of the mutual orbit of eclipsing binaries that are physically connected can be obtained by precision timing of minima over time through light travel time effect, apsidal motion or orbital precession. This, however, requires joint analysis of data from different sources obtained through various techniques and with insufficiently quantified uncertainties. In particular, photometric uncertainties are often underestimated, which yields too small uncertainties in minima timings if determined through analysis of a χ2 surface. The task is even more difficult for double eclipsing binaries, especially those with periods close to a resonance such as CzeV344, where minima get often blended with each other.

This code solves the double binary parameters simultaneously and then uses these parameters to determine minima timings (or more specifically O-C values) for individual datasets. In both cases, the uncertainties (or more precisely confidence intervals) are determined through bootstrap resampling of the original data. This procedure to a large extent alleviates the common problem with underestimated photometric uncertainties and provides a check on possible degeneracies in the parameters and the stability of the results. While there are shortcomings to this method as well when compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, the ease of the implementation of bootstrapping is a significant advantage.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06011C</bibcode><topic_id>28959</topic_id><views>43</views><site>http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pejcha/czev343/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4058</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.012</ascl_id><title>Time Utilities</title><credit>Eastman, Jason</credit><abstract>Time Utilities are software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD to a precision of 1 μs for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft. As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We recommend using BJD_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extraterrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 μs, and provide software for download and online webapps for use.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft06012E</bibcode><topic_id>28960</topic_id><views>49</views><site>http://astroutils.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/time/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122..935E</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1206.013</ascl_id><title>ImageJ: Image processing and analysis in Java</title><credit>Rasband, W.

The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing—not even the image scale—is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis.

It has a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows the image data associated with aperture photometry calculations for point and extended sources to be visualized and, therefore, more effectively analyzed. Mouse-clicking on a source in the displayed image draws a circular or elliptical aperture and sky annulus around the source and computes the source intensity and its uncertainty, along with several commonly used measures of the local sky background and its variability. The results are displayed and can be optionally saved to an aperture-photometry-table file and plotted on graphs in various ways using functions available in the software. APT is geared toward processing sources in a small number of images and is not suitable for bulk processing a large number of images, unlike other aperture photometry packages (e.g., <a href="http://ascl.net/1010.064">SExtractor</a>). However, APT does have a convenient source-list tool that enables calculations for a large number of detections in a given image. The source-list tool can be run either in automatic mode to generate an aperture photometry table quickly or in manual mode to permit inspection and adjustment of the calculation for each individual detection. APT displays a variety of useful graphs,  including image histogram, and aperture slices, source scatter plot, sky scatter plot, sky histogram, radial profile, curve of growth, and aperture-photometry-table scatter plots and histograms. APT has functions for customizing calculations, including outlier rejection, pixel “picking” and “zapping,” and a selection of source and sky models. The radial-profile-interpolation source model, accessed via the radial-profile-plot panel, allows recovery of source intensity from pixels with missing data and can be especially beneficial in crowded fields.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft08003L</bibcode><topic_id>29315</topic_id><views>65</views><site>http://www.aperturephotometry.org/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...25R</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1208.004</ascl_id><title>PyKE: Reduction and analysis of Kepler Simple Aperture Photometry data</title><credit>Still, Martin; Barclay, Tom</credit><abstract>PyKE is a python-based <a href="http://ascl.net/1207.011">PyRAF</a> package that can also be run as a stand-alone program within a unix-based shell without compiling against PyRAF.

Previous incarnations of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement version of VAC were of restricted use only, and have been used for basic research in AMR strategies, or for well-targeted applications. This MPI version uses a full octree block-based approach, and allows for general orthogonal coordinate systems. MPI-AMRVAC aims to advance any system of (primarily hyperbolic) partial differential equations by a number of different numerical schemes. The emphasis is on (near) conservation laws, with shock-dominated problems as a main research target. The actual equations are stored in separate modules, can be added if needed, and they can be selected by a simple configuration of the VACPP preprocessor. The dimensionality of the problem is also set through VACPP.

The input is raw time series data, in almost any form. Three data modes are elaborated: (1) time-tagged events, (2) binned counts, and (3) measurements at arbitrary times with normal errors. The output is the most probable segmentation of the observation interval into sub-intervals during which the signal is perceptibly constant, i.e. has no statistically significant variations. The idea is not that the source is deemed to actually have this discontinuous, piecewise constant form, rather that such an approximate and generic model is often useful. Treatment of data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise linear and piecewise exponential representations, multi-variate time series data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed data are included.

Modelling rotational modulations allows one to invert the observations into several basic parameters, such as the rotation period, spot coverage, stellar inclination and differential rotation rate. The most widely used analytic model for this inversion comes from Budding (1977) and Dorren (1987), who considered circular, grey starspots for a linearly limb darkened star. That model is extended to be more suitable in the analysis of high precision photometry such as that by Kepler. Macula, a Fortran 90 code, provides several improvements, such as non-linear limb darkening of the star and spot, a single-domain analytic function, partial derivatives for all input parameters, temporal partial derivatives, diluted light compensation, instrumental offset normalisations, differential rotation, starspot evolution and predictions of transit depth variations due to unocculted spots. The inclusion of non-linear limb darkening means macula has a maximum photometric error an order-of-magnitude less than that of Dorren (1987) for Sun-like stars observed in the Kepler-bandpass. The code executes three orders-of-magnitude faster than comparable numerical codes making it well-suited for inference problems.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft09006K</bibcode><topic_id>29548</topic_id><views>36</views><site>https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dkipping/macula.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2985</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1209.007</ascl_id><title>TMCalc: Fast estimation of stellar metallicity [Fe/H]</title><credit>Sousa, Sérgio G.; Santos, Nuno C.; Israelian, Garik</credit><abstract>TMCalc is a C code developed as an extension to ARES.

Numerical models are defined on the front-end via a Python-based Tree Definition Language (TDL), then rapidly executed on the back-end. The use of TDL facilitates an extremely short turn-around time for experimentation with new ideas. This is also helped by unprecedented visualization capabilities for all final and intermediate results. A flexible data model and a number of important optimizations in the back-end ensures that the numerical performance is comparable to that of hand-written code.

This post-processing mainly consists in subtracting the total low-frequency noise (both its thermal and non-thermal components), masking cosmic ray hit residuals, and projecting the data onto a map. Although it was developed for Herschel, it is also applicable with minimal adjustment to scan observations made with other bolometer arrays provided they entail sufficient redundancy; it was successfully applied to P-Artemis, an instrument operating on the APEX telescope. Scanamorphos does not assume any particular noise model and does not apply any Fourier-space filtering to the data. It is an empirical tool using only the redundancy built in the observations, taking advantage of the fact that each portion of the sky is sampled at multiple times by multiple bolometers.

A classical application of this statistic is the galaxy-galaxy correlation function to find constraints on the parameter Omega_m or the location of the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak. This calculation, however, is very expensive in terms of computer power and Graphics Processing Units provide one solution for efficient analysis of the increasingly larger galaxy surveys that are currently taking place.

GP2PCF is a public code in CUDA for performing this computation; with a single GPU board it is possible to achieve 120-fold speedups with respect to a standard implementation in C running on a single CPU.

SGNAPS is derived from the plotting tools of <a href="http://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/vipgi.html">VIPGI</a> and contains almost all of their capabilities.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft10005P</bibcode><topic_id>29720</topic_id><views>41</views><site>http://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/sgnaps.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PASP..117.1284S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1210.006</ascl_id><title>TA-DA: A Tool for Astrophysical Data Analysis</title><credit>Da Rio, Nicola; Robberto, Massimo</credit><abstract>TA-DA is a pre-compiled IDL widget-based application which greatly simplifies and improves the analysis of stellar photometric data in comparison with theoretical models and allows the derivation of stellar parameters from multi-band photometry.

D.; Draine, Bruce</credit><abstract>PAHFIT is an IDL tool for decomposing Spitzer IRS spectra of PAH emission sources, with a special emphasis on the careful recovery of ambiguous silicate absorption, and weak, blended dust emission features. PAHFIT is primarily designed for use with full 5-35 micron Spitzer low-resolution IRS spectra. PAHFIT is a flexible tool for fitting spectra, and you can add or disable features, compute combined flux bands, change fitting limits, etc., without changing the code.

PAHFIT uses a simple, physically-motivated model, consisting of starlight, thermal dust continuum in a small number of fixed temperature bins, resolved dust features and feature blends, prominent emission lines (which themselves can be blended with dust features), as well as simple fully-mixed or screen dust extinction, dominated by the silicate absorption bands at 9.7 and 18 microns. Most model components are held fixed or are tightly constrained. PAHFIT uses Drude profiles to recover the full strength of dust emission features and blends, including the significant power in the wings of the broad emission profiles. This means the resulting feature strengths are larger (by factors of 2-4) than are recovered by methods which estimate the underlying continuum using line segments or spline curves fit through fiducial wavelength anchors.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft10009S</bibcode><topic_id>29749</topic_id><views>38</views><site>http://tir.astro.utoledo.edu/jdsmith/research/pahfit.php</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...656..770S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1210.010</ascl_id><title>CALCLENS: Curved-sky grAvitational Lensing for Cosmological Light conE simulatioNS</title><credit>Becker, Matthew R.</credit><abstract>CALCLENS, written in C and employing widely available software libraries, efficiently computes weak gravitational lensing shear signals from large N-body light cone simulations over a curved sky. The algorithm properly accounts for the sky curvature and boundary conditions, is able to produce redshift-dependent shear signals including corrections to the Born approximation by using multiple-plane ray tracing, and properly computes the lensed images of source galaxies in the light cone. The key feature of this algorithm is a new, computationally efficient Poisson solver for the sphere that combines spherical harmonic transform and multgrid methods. As a result, large areas of sky (~10,000 square degrees) can be ray traced efficiently at high-resolution using only a few hundred cores on widely available machines. Coupled with realistic galaxy populations placed in large N-body light cone simulations, CALCLENS is ideally suited for the construction of synthetic weak lensing shear catalogs to be used to test for systematic effects in data analysis procedures for upcoming large-area sky surveys.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft10010B</bibcode><topic_id>29747</topic_id><views>57</views><site>http://code.google.com/p/calclens/</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3069</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1210.011</ascl_id><title>Consistent Trees: Gravitationally Consistent Halo Catalogs and Merger Trees for Precision Cosmology</title><credit>Behroozi, Peter S.; Wechsler, Risa H.; Wu, Hao-Yi; Busha, Michael T.; Klypin, Anatoly A.; Primack, Joel R.</credit><abstract>Consistent Trees generates merger trees and halo catalogs which explicitly ensure consistency of halo properties (mass, position, velocity, radius) across timesteps.

McPHAC incorporates several improvements over previous codes for which tabulated model spectra are available: (1) Thomson scattering is treated anisotropically, which is shown to result in a 0.2%-3% correction in the emergent spectral flux across the 0.1-5 keV passband; (2) the McPHAC source code is made available to the community, allowing it to be scrutinized and modified by other researchers wishing to study or extend its capabilities; and (3) the numerical uncertainty resulting from the discrete and iterative solution is studied as a function of photon energy, indicating that McPHAC is capable of producing spectra with numerical uncertainties &lt;0.01%. The accuracy of the spectra may at present be limited to ~1%, but McPHAC enables researchers to study the impact of uncertain inputs and additional physical effects, thereby supporting future efforts to reduce those inaccuracies. Comparison of McPHAC results with spectra from one of the previous model atmosphere codes (NSA) shows agreement to lsim1% near the peaks of the emergent spectra. However, in the Wien tail a significant deficit of flux in the spectra of the previous model is revealed, determined to be due to the previous work not considering large enough optical depths at the highest photon frequencies. The deficit is most significant for spectra with T eff &lt; 105.6 K, though even there it may not be of much practical importance for most observations.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft10017H</bibcode><topic_id>29791</topic_id><views>43</views><site>https://github.com/McPHAC/McPHAC</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749...52H</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1210.018</ascl_id><title>Systemic Console: Advanced analysis of exoplanetary data</title><credit>Meschiari, Stefano; Wolf, Aaron S.; Rivera, Eugenio; Laughlin, Gregory; Vogt, Steve; Butler, Paul</credit><abstract>Systemic Console is a tool for advanced analysis of exoplanetary data.

Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be unreliable in the case of IFS data, and the optimal parameter settings are usually unknown a priori for a given dataset. The Calar Alto legacy integral field area (CALIFA) survey generates hundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm for cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data reduction pipeline. PyCosmic combines the edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function convolution scheme. PyCosmic is the only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA data. Only for strongly undersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a few percent.

The algorithm is an extension of Cappellari & Copin's (2003) <a href="http://ascl.net/1211.006">Voronoi binning code</a> and uses Weighted Voronoi Tesselations (WVT) to produce a very compact binning structure with a constant S/N per bin. The bin size adjusts to the required resolution in single-pixel steps, which minimizes the scatter around the target S/N. The code is very versatile and can in principle be applied to any type of data.

C-m Emu is a simple numerical code for the c-M relation as a function of cosmological parameters for wCDM models generates the best-fit power-law model for each redshift separately and then interpolate between the redshifts. This produces a more accurate answer at each redshift at the minimal cost of running a fast code for every c -M prediction instead of using one fitting formula. The emulator is constructed from 37 individual models, with three nested N-body gravity-only simulations carried out for each model. The mass range covered by the emulator is 2 x 10^{12} M_sun &lt; M &lt;10^{15} M_sun with a corresponding redshift range of z=0 -1. Over this range of mass and redshift, as well as the variation of cosmological parameters studied, the mean halo concentration varies from c ~ 2 to c ~ 8. The distribution of the concentration at fixed mass is Gaussian with a standard deviation of one-third of the mean value, almost independent of cosmology, mass, and redshift over the ranges probed by the simulations.</abstract><bibcode>2012ascl.soft11005K</bibcode><topic_id>30266</topic_id><views>61</views><site>http://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/CosmicEmu/emu.html</site><ref>http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1576</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1211.006</ascl_id><title>Voronoi binning method</title><credit>Cappellari, Michele; Copin, Yannick</credit><abstract>The Voronoi binning method is an IDL program to bin two-dimensional data to a constant signal-to-noise ratio per bin.

The extension follows the approach of Athena's original developers and has been designed to alter the existing Cartesian-coordinates code as minimally and transparently as possible. The numerical equations in cylindrical coordinates are formulated to maintain consistency with constrained transport (CT), a central feature of the Athena algorithm, while making use of previously implemented code modules such as the Riemann solvers.

It includes preparatory steps such as image background matching, photometric gain-matching, and pixel-outlier rejection. Co-addition and/or HiRes'ing can be performed in either the inertial WCS or in the rest frame of a moving object. Three interpolation methods are supported: overlap-area weighting, drizzle, and weighting by the detector Point Response Function (PRF). The latter enables the creation of matched-filtered products for optimal point-source detection, but most importantly allows for resolution enhancement using a spatially-dependent deconvolution method. This is a variant of the classic Richardson-Lucy algorithm with the added benefit to simultaneously register and co-add multiple images to optimize signal-to-noise and sampling of the instrumental PSF. It can assume real (or otherwise "flat") image priors, mitigate "ringing" artifacts, and assess the quality of image solutions using statistically-motivated convergence criteria. Uncertainties are also estimated and internally validated for all products. The software supports multithreading that can be configured for different architectures. Numerous example scripts are included (with test data) to co-add and/or HiRes image data from Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS, WISE, and Herschel-SPIRE.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft02010M</bibcode><topic_id>30755</topic_id><views>40</views><site>http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/home/icore.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....144...68J</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1302.011</ascl_id><title>GALA: Stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances</title><credit>Mucciarelli, A.; Pancino, E.; Lovisi, L.; Ferraro, F.

The abundances of individual spectral lines are derived by using the WIDTH9 code developed by R. L. Kurucz. GALA is designed to obtain the best model atmosphere, by optimizing temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity, after rejecting the discrepant lines. Finally, it computes accurate internal errors for each atmospheric parameter and abundance.

This code simulates the long term evolution of spherical clusters of stars; it was devised specifically to treat dense galactic nuclei. It is based on the pioneering Monte Carlo scheme proposed by Hénon in the 70's and includes all relevant physical ingredients (2-body relaxation, stellar mass spectrum, collisions, tidal disruption, ldots). It is basically a Monte Carlo resolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. It can cope with any stellar mass spectrum or velocity distribution. Being a particle-based method, it also allows one to take stellar collisions into account in a very realistic way. This unique code, featuring most important physical processes, allows million particle simulations, spanning a Hubble time, in a few CPU days on standard personal computers and provides a wealth of data only rivalized by N-body simulations.

Thereby, the correct normalization of operations on fields is taken care of automatically. This allows for an abstract formulation and programming of inference algorithms, including those derived within information field theory. Thus, NIFTY permits rapid prototyping of algorithms in 1D and then the application of the developed code in higher-dimensional settings of real world problems. NIFTY operates on point sets, n-dimensional regular grids, spherical spaces, their harmonic counterparts, and product spaces constructed as combinations of those.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft02013S</bibcode><topic_id>30796</topic_id><views>52</views><site>http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ift/nifty/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1301.4499S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1302.014</ascl_id><title>SYNMAG Photometry: Catalog-level Matched Colors of Extended Sources</title><credit>Bundy, Kevin; Hogg, David W.; Higgs, Tim D.; Nichol, Robert C.; Yasuda, Naoki; Masters, Karen L.; Lang, Dustin; Wake, David A.</credit><abstract>SYNMAG is a tool for producing synthetic aperture magnitudes to enable fast matched photometry at the catalog level without reprocessing imaging data.

Wind accretion, where the secondary may accrete some of the material lost from the primary in a wind, is allowed with the necessary adjustments made to the orbital parameters in the event of any mass variations. Mass transfer occurs if either star fills its Roche lobe and may proceed on a nuclear, thermal or dynamical time-scale. In the latter regime, the radius of the primary increases in response to mass-loss at a faster rate than the Roche-lobe of the star. Prescriptions to determine the type and rate of mass transfer, the response of the secondary to accretion and the outcome of any merger events are in place in BSE.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft03014H</bibcode><topic_id>30958</topic_id><views>86</views><site>http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jhurley/bsedload.html</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.329..897H</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1303.015</ascl_id><title>SSE: Single Star Evolution</title><credit>Hurley, Jarrod R.; Pols, Onno R.; Tout, Christopher A.</credit><abstract>SSE is a rapid single-star evolution (SSE) code; these analytical formulae cover all phases of evolution from the zero-age main-sequence up to and including remnant phases.

It is tuned for optimal coordinate search performance (Radial Search, Box Search, Rectangular Search) of huge catalogs, thus increasing the speed by more than an order of magnitude when compared to simple indexing on a single table. Optimal conditions enable more than 3,000 searches per second for radial search of 2MASS PSC. The kit is best characterized by its flexible tuning. Each table index is registered in one of six table spaces (each resides in a separate directory), thus allowing only the essential parts to be easily moved onto fast devices. Given the terrific evolution that has taken place with recent SSDs in performance, a very cost-effective way of constructing high-performance servers is moving part of or all table indices to a fast SSD.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft03016Y</bibcode><topic_id>30961</topic_id><views>87</views><site>http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~cyamauch/2masskit/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASP..123.1324Y</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1303.017</ascl_id><title>CADRE: CArma Data REduction pipeline</title><credit>Friedel, Douglas</credit><abstract>CADRE, the Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) data reduction pipeline, gives investigators a first look at a fully reduced set of their data.

The magnetic field is updated separately in two-dimensional advection-constraint steps. The electromotive force (EMF) is computed in the advection step using the TVD scheme, and this same EMF is used immediately in the constraint step in order to preserve ∇˙B=0 without the need to store intermediate fluxes. The code is extended to three dimensions using operator splitting, and Runge-Kutta is used to get second-order accuracy in time. TVD offers high-resolution per grid cell, second-order accuracy in space and time, and enforcement of the ∇˙B=0 constraint to machine precision.

Written in C++, NEST is an add-on module for the <a href="http://ascl.net/1010.079">Geant4</a> simulation package that incorporates more detailed physics than is currently available into the simulation of scintillation. NEST is of particular use for low-energy nuclear recoils. All available liquid xenon data on nuclear recoils and electron recoils to date have been taken into consideration in arriving at the current models. NEST also handles the magnitude of the light and charge yields of nuclear recoils, including their electric field dependence, thereby shedding light on the possibility of detection or exclusion of a low-mass dark matter WIMP by liquid xenon detectors.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft07017S</bibcode><topic_id>31811</topic_id><views>42</views><site>http://nest.physics.ucdavis.edu/site/</site><ref>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/6/10/P10002</ref><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1307.6601S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1307.018</ascl_id><title>ETC++: Advanced Exposure-Time Calculations</title><credit>Bernstein, Gary</credit><abstract>ETC++ is a exposure-time calculator that considers the effect of cosmic rays, undersampling, dithering, and imperfect pixel response functions.

The input is a galaxy ellipticity catalog with each measured galaxy shape treated as a noisy tracer of the reduced shear field, which is inferred on a fine pixel grid assuming  positivity, and smoothness on scales of w arcsec where w is an input parameter.

The package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a general n by n matrix A. It is most appropriate for large sparse or structured matrices A where structured means that a matrix-vector product w <- Av requires order n rather than the usual order n2 floating point operations. This software is based upon an algorithmic variant of the Arnoldi process called the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM). When the matrix A is symmetric it reduces to a variant of the Lanczos process called the Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Method (IRLM). These variants may be viewed as a synthesis of the Arnoldi/Lanczos process with the Implicitly Shifted QR technique that is suitable for large scale problems. For many standard problems, a matrix factorization is not required; only the action of the matrix on a vector is needed. ARPACK is capable of solving large scale symmetric, nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant application areas.</abstract><bibcode>2013ascl.soft11010L</bibcode><topic_id>32682</topic_id><views>150</views><site>http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000APS..MARM19003T</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1311.011</ascl_id><title>MUSIC: MUlti-Scale Initial Conditions</title><credit>Hahn, Oliver; Abel, Tom</credit><abstract>MUSIC generates multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological ‘zoom-in’ simulations.

The Beta prior is an excellent description of the current, empirically determined distribution of orbital eccentricities and thus employing it naturally incorporates an observer’s prior experience of what types of orbits are probable or improbable.

The key idea of RM is to measure the time lag τ between variations in the continuum emission from the accretion disc and subsequent response of the broad line region (BLR). The measurement of τ is typically used to estimate the physical size of the BLR and is combined with other measurements to estimate the black hole mass MBH. A major difficulty with RM campaigns is the large amount of data needed to measure τ.

In addition, Comet provides a tool for publishing VOEvents to the global VOEvent backbone.</abstract><bibcode>2014ascl.soft04008S</bibcode><topic_id>33272</topic_id><views>84</views><site>https://github.com/jdswinbank/Comet</site><site>http://comet.transientskp.org/</site><ref>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.428.3114S</ref></code><code><ascl_id>1404.009</ascl_id><title>carma_pack: MCMC sampler for Bayesian inference</title><credit>Kelly, Brandon C.; Becker, Andrew</credit><abstract>carma_pack is an MCMC sampler for performing Bayesian inference on continuous time autoregressive moving average models.

It then gives the multiple-redshift outputs for power spectrum, and optionally provides correlation function data. The Fortran code has two major options for power spectrum calculations; -fast, which quickly computes the power spectrum at two-loop level (typically a few seconds) using the pre-computed data set of PT kernels for fiducial cosmological models, and -direct, in which the code first applies the fast method, and then follows the regularized expression for power spectrum to directly evaluate the multi-dimensional integrals. The output results are the power spectrum of direct calculation and difference of the results between fast and direct method.

Its object-oriented design allows new types of image components (2D surface-brightness functions) to be easily written and added to the program. Image functions provided with Imfit include Sersic, exponential, and Gaussian galaxy decompositions along with Core-Sersic and broken-exponential profiles, elliptical rings, and three components that perform line-of-sight integration through 3D luminosity-density models of disks and rings seen at arbitrary inclinations.

Available minimization algorithms include Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead simplex, and Differential Evolution, allowing trade-offs between speed and decreased sensitivity to local minima in the fit landscape. Minimization can be done using the standard chi^2 statistic (using either data or model values to estimate per-pixel Gaussian errors, or else user-supplied error images) or the Cash statistic; the latter is particularly appropriate for cases of Poisson data in the low-count regime.
